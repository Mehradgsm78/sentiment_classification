201,"I had a fried fish taco ($4.95) and tortilla chips ($3.75) here and they were delicious.  I was with my husband and a group of friends, so I think among all of us we tried every single taco they offer.  Note that they only have 1 vegetarian option (and no vegan options on the menu, although you may be able to make a special request).  Luckily the vegetarian option is vegetables wrapped in crispy cheese, and the one vegetarian in our group loves cheese, lol.  

The fish in my taco was crispy on the outside and soft and flaky on the inside.  It was battered and fried, but didn't taste overly greasy.  The fish was on top of shredded cabbage, and a green creamy sauce was drizzled on top.  

Chips were crispy and didn't taste like they came out of a bag. I liked the creamy avocado dipping sauce they came with, but would have appreciated a more mainstream salsa as well, lol (you know, like the one with cut up tomatoes). 

Can't wait to try their other tacos.

This location is in The Annex Food Hall.",2
718,"Unfortunately they did not let us make reservations probably because of the small size of the restaurant. 

I had a really uncomfortable time at this restaurant... let me tell you why...

The seating arrangement of the tables was very poor. 

We were seated on the second floor at a small table. There was another table, located one foot away from us, between us and the wall/window. Directly behind my friends seat was another table, so when she sat down, her chair was almost touching this other table. Directly behind my chair was someone else's chair. We were squished!!

When I sat down my chair was back to back with their chair. There was no room for the people in the table at the window to get out and for the servers to get over to them, so my friend and I had to stand up and tuck our chair in to let them through. When another couple came and sat there, I also had to stand up again and push my chair in to let them through. This was incredibly uncomfortable. 

A restaurant is supposed to be a relaxing place, especially when you are spending hard working money. I shouldn't be standing up and needing to let people through time and time again.

When serving the table behind me, the server had to squeeze behind my chair and stand right against the back and the side of my chair. It was not a relaxing dining experience at all! Service was okay at best, when they weren't getting me to stand up or squish us.

I ordered the malfalde ai fungi, it tasted delicious for the first few bites but the cream was so rich it was difficult to finish and I felt a little nauseous at the end. 

I expected much better!",0
349,"Went here for ayce tacos Thursdays ($19.95), only available until end of November I believe 

Food (4/5): very good tacos that were way better than I expected for ayce. They were proper really good restaurant quality tacos! I love that they used corn tortillas and were generous with the filling! I tried all taco flavors and recommend the tinga de pollo, chorizo, barbacua and carnitas 

Price (5/5): ayce tacos at this price point is a STEAL. 

Service (3/5): the waiter deserves 5/5, he was super attentive and pleasant throughout the course of our meal. However we waited 45 min to an hour for our first tacos to come out from the kitchen. Tacos came out at a reasonable pace after that but the initial wait was painful.

Ambiance (3.5/5): very clean, cozy spot in Trinity bellwoods. The mural on the wall was a nice touch",2
137,This place serves some really great tacos! Service is very quick as we got our food in a couple of minutes. We were seated at the bar and were able to see everything being made fresh. Everything was delicious and my favourite is the Pescado!,2
204,The tacos took forever to make but they were delicious! Fresh off the grill and straight into our bellies real quick. I especially enjoyed the baja fish taco - it had just the right amount of crispiness and was not too salty like other baha fish tacos that I've tried. It was just right. What I really appreciated was that the chef personally delivered us our food. Now that's above and beyond! Would be down for coming back again.,2
1635,"One cold winter afternoon... hungry... cold... wandering mindlessly downtown, I stumbled upon Zhang's Kitchen tucked in the southern side of Elm Street. 

The restaurant itself is not big and I arrived late afternoon. An eerie quietness besets the restaurant. After settling down they started putting on some mandarin pop songs and handed over water and the paper menu.  Service was courteous and efficient. 

Menu wise is extremely limited here, they specialize in yellow braised dishes.  I chose yellow braised chicken with thick noodles; a fine choice for a frigid day. The sauce that was reduced and used to braised the chicken was excellent. The simple flavours created by the cooking wine, ginger, scallion, leek, and other ingredients was delicious and would warm any stomach or heart.  The chicken was equally done well. The chicken was fall off the bones texture (even though their chicken was bone-less) without giving any feeling of it being overcooked. 

What prompted a less than four star when everything sounded great? A few things... first the noodles lacked texture. They were pretty limp and felt like overcooked store bought versions. The mushroom that was added to the dish were the wet variety and the flavour of the mushroom failed to transfer to the sauce. They also added strings of green pepper on top of the dish for aesthetic purposes. This may be a personal thing but I hate when green peppers become fully cooked (while not having been grilled). 

Overall score for Zhang's Kitchen is a solid 3.4. Unless they work on their noodles, you may want to stick with rice.",1
579,"I rarely ever review restaurants but this was extraordinarily mediocre. Fish stunk, guacamole was too hot (no flavour, just heat) and the service was slow. Don't bother",0
1792,"Inauthentic and bland. Red flags: No classic numbing spice flavor. Missed the spot on 2 signature dishes so I won't be coming back. 

The cold noodles appetizer was had noodles that were thick and tasted like spaghetti and old lard. No complimentary contents either--you can usually expect some sesame oil or thinly chopped black fungus or something but this was a low effort fail completely. 

The ""mouth watering chicken"" which is a cold chicken dish was sitting in a pool of chili oil and soy sauce (which is normal) but completely lacked flavor and spice--it should carry the sweet flavor of cooking wine, the saltiness of soy sauce and have the savory ""ma la"" numbing spice that makes your lips and tongue tingle. The only thing resembling the classic dish was the fact that the chicken was rather bony and gristly. I had to ask for more hua jiao (si chuan pepper) oil to make it edible 

I'm horribly disappointed and the two dishes cost me $14. It's overpriced at this rate. The decor is austere but rundown (fake wooden footbridge leading into banquet style restaurant that looks tatty) and I guess the fact it was empty on a Friday evening at 9 was highly suspect. Please just go to Si Chuan house cuisine if you're looking for anything nearly close to spicy",0
1796,"Sweet and sour soup was good. Dumplings were good.  Our meals were bleh. Had Tsao chicken, which looked very nice but was more deep fried pieces than chunks of chicken.  My spouse had chicken with ginger and scallions which he enjoyed. A friend had some beef dish that was indescribable.",0
365,"Love all of the hidden gems in Kensington Market, and La Chilaca Taqueria is no exception - it's awesome.

Super tiny spot, located in the middle of the building, which houses other niche food stalls.

In terms of eating in, there are community folding tables and chairs at the back of the space, super rustic vibes but you don't come here for the Instagram photo opps if you know what I mean.

The service was friendly and quick, we were able to place our orders quickly.

Tacos were absolutely delicious - I can't recall the exact ones we tried but they were amazing. Super flavourful, tender, and just really tasty.

Make sure you ask for a side of their green salsa on the side, its sooooo good. We ended up taking the bit we had leftover and used them on fried eggs for breakfast the next morning - omg hot sauce heaven. 

If anyone from La Chilaca Taqueria reads this, please consider making batches of your hot sauce to sell, it's addictive!",2
1840,"This place was ok. We tried the roasted duck, roasted pork, and bbq pork, and pork tongue. Taste was average. Duck was very hard to bite through. Meats were cut sloppily and some barely cut. Floor was sticky. With so many better options around, probably won't try again.",1
82,"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go.",1
927,"I ordered the Siciliana pasta. For the prices that everything is on the menu, it's definitely worth it. We all got a pretty big portion. In terms of taste however, it didn't really blow me away. 

Although the food took quite some time to get to us (30 minutes) the service was great. I had this waitress from Ireland who was quite nice. When I wasn't sure of which wine to get, she also brought me tasters. 

Overall, it's a good place for fairly cheap Italian food but it didn't blow my socks off.",1
885,"Wow! 
Now I know Italian food doesn't get better than this. The burrata pizza with truffles was like tasting heaven and then coming back, just amazing... I would recommend it to share it with others and try their amazing duck pasta which is super rich in flavour :) also do not forget to leave some space for dessert!!",2
1890,"If you are looking for more fusion dim sum, this is the right place for you. Really love the foie gras tart, the lobster dumpling is pretty good. Didn't like the turnip cake and caviar dumpling as much. Ordered the deep fry veg bean curd roll that's really good too forgot to attach the picture here. The truffle chicken dumplings were okay.
It's a little pricy compare with other dim sum restaurants. 

I would say the food is 3.5 stars but the price of the parking and service made it to 4 stars. 


The parking is cheap as it is located in downtown.",2
369,"I came here to try out some tacos.  The tacos average in price about $5 each.  They have different sauces that you can put on your tacos.   I tried the pork tacos.  While it wasn't bad, it wasn't memorable either.  

This place is located inside and there are other businesses inside as well.  It was hot and stuffy.  The restaurant wasn't the cleanest either.  

Overall, it was just ok.  A bit cheaper than the more famous place across the street.",1
1570,"I was craving for noodle so we saw this place on Yelp and decided to give it a try. We came at lunch time and there were a lot of people in the line  15-20 people, but the line move really quick so we ended up wait around 15'. Why I was waiting in line, I got to watch the people inside hand made the noodle, that was so awesome and how much work that put in to have a yummy bowl of noodle. We decided to try the big bowl of beef noodle. The noodle is really good, we chose the thick noodle and not so chewy. The soup was tasty and add a little bit spicy to it, it was so good.",2
575,"Super-nice back patio and friendly service. Artfully made food. My wife and I stumbled by accidentally. We'd already had dinner earlier that night, but the restaurant's pleasant exterior beckoned. 

Before we knew it we were seated on the back patio. 

We each ordered a couple of tacos and they were nicely done. I really enjoyed my Hongos taco. Perfectly rolled and dressed; crispy and well presented on a thin rectangular plate. 

We were going to leave it at that, but the desert really grabbed us. 

So- 10 years ago I fell in love with avocado gelato. It's really good but I've only seen it made at one gelato place that has long been out of business.  Anyhow, my wife was really excited to spot that on the menu, there it was!!! Avocado gelato. Served with churros and sauce.  Yummm.  So good. Highly recommended. 

We'll be back for a proper dinner for sure.  

Check out the back patio while it's still warmish out. (As I write this, it's almost officially Fall). Cheers!",2
16,"I've been duped by yelp reviews!! We were given recommendations for this place as a great lunch spot which was super cute inside and patio area was so inviting. The stars were for the decor and the one dish! 

Food we ordered:
Chile Rellenos- with rice and black beans- this was the star dish for sure, two large chille rellenos and delicious rice. Sauce was tasty as well. 

Guacamole- prepared guacamole probably mixed with fresh avocado, you can just tell it's from a bag because it's watery instead of creamy. Not special at all

Grilled fish tacos- this is so upsetting, they said it was bass, well it's not. If it was it's the mushiest bass I've ever eaten. Three little tacos that that hid the tiny piece of fish for $19 bucks! Sad don't get this

So disappointed",1
1753,"The number one dim sum and mom-and-pop shop in Toronto - hands down. The dim sum comes out steamy hot and the dishes are deliciously flavourful! 

We ordered the ha how, siu mai, garlic squid, spinach dumpling, and a bunch of other dishes too. For 2 people, I suggest ordering at least  6 or 7 dishes (each are around $3-4). Our total came to $35 with tax and tip. This restaurant is a definitely among my top 10 places to eat in Toronto. I am in a dim sum nirvana just reminiscing about our dinner here. Only locals know about this place so it's almost never packed.

Pro tip: You need to order at the counter. So pick up an order slip, choose wisely on your fav dishes, and hand it back to the person behind the counter. 

Prop tip 2: You'll need to ""self-serve"". So grab your plates, chopsticks, tea, etc. They only bring you the food. The food makes up for this so I don't care.

Prop tip 3: There's tables that seat up to 4, so don't come with a crowd of 10 or more. 

Transit directions: Take the TTC to Donlands Station, walk towards Danforth (turn right when you exit the station entrance) and then when you're on Danforth, look straight across. It's a bit hidden, but well worth the find.

When we were here, there was a white dude working with the Chinese mom, dad, and uncle. We had speculated that he was adopted but didn't ask. Anyways, they were all super nice. 

Pro tip 4: They deliver locally and have lunch specials.

I wish I lived nearby because I'd be here at least once a week. It's my dim sum secret place, more of an ""super elite spot"" in my books. In comparison, the food here is far superior than compared to any dim sum restaurant near Dundas and Spadina. I think it's their family recipes that are used and the fact that the owners really care about the art of dim sum making. A must eat!",2
213,"Stumbled upon this restaurant while searching for lunch before heading to Yorkdale. The restaurant is quite small, more of a takeout joint and seats about 6 people. The restaurant is very hot and humid and there was only one fan facing the window. There is free street parking (depending on the time), however there is paid parking directly in front of the restaurant.

We ordered the 3 for $12 ( Black Tiger Shrimp, Fish & Carnitas tacos). The food was flavourful, however it didn't hit the spot for me. We also took advantage of the free chips and salsa check in offer.

Overall, nice presentation of the tacos but I wouldn't be going out of my way to come back to satisfy my taco cravings.",1
1154,"Not even going to talk about the food here because the service here was abysmal. We asked for 3 cups of hot water and were charged $1.50/cup. When we asked the waiter why they charge for hot water they mentioned that all restaurants in yorkville charge for water. After suggesting some of the restaurants  we regularly visit that offer complimentary hot water, the waitress said, ""I guess those restaurants aren't high end anyway...""

I'm sorry, kasa moto and one have $$$ and $$$$ ratings while this barn has $$. Snobs.",0
554,"This year has really started off well for me (at least in terms of food haha)

King Tacos is a family-run Mexican restaurant on St. Clair West. We ordered Gaucamole, Chicken Tacos and Beef Bistec Tacos. 

You do get free fresh chips and sauces with all orders, which I think is super! 

The whole concept is amazing. You get FRESH tacos in a taco box, you assemble it yourself, which I think is nice. You also get 3 different sauces to add to your tacos and you can add cheese too! 

It's very authentic and similar to how it is in Mexico! It's quite a large restaurant with lots of seating. The only thing I would say it as it's family run, it's a little slow. They're definitely hospitable and friendly but the service is a little slow, even for a weekend lunch. I won't ding them for this because the flavours of everything we ordered was scrumptious. Large portions don't hurt either ;)",2
403,"I'm all for small, authentic , family run business , and this is exactly what you get at Mexico Lindo. 
My friend and I visited on a Wednesday afternoon & we were one of two tables. I ordered the guacamole, & fish tacos (on special on Wednesday's) & my friend ordered the beef chimichanga. 
The guacamole was amazing- lasted us 3-4 refills of chips. It was fresh, smooth & the perfect consistency. I just wish it came with better salsa (tasted like the basic Tostitos one out of the jar). 
The fish tacos- were okay at most. Not much flavour in the tacos (I've had better at JOEYS & other chain restos). Their rice however was fresh & delicious and their salad tasted like a Greek salad but was still very good. Also- there was nothing spicy or flavourful about the dish which is why I was  disappointed. 
The chimichangas- my friend ordered beef but got chicken. Not the biggest deal to us but still odd how the waitress forgot when we were one of two tables. She liked her dish and it was so filling! 

Overall, my friend and I both left with take out boxes because of how filling everything was. Majority - if not all- plates come with beans, rice & salad. Service and food were mediocre at best (the birchmount express location is much better) but I will come back here to support the family's business.",1
1772,"Last week, I decided to get take out from a nearby restaurant. They said it would take twenty minutes, so I decided to walk around instead of waiting at the restaurant. I had killed some time and by the time I had looped around, I thought hey maybe I can grab one of my favorite treats as dessert. Dynasty was right there, so I went upstairs, proceeded to the counter, looked at their priceless* dim sum menu and ordered one order of the steamed egg yolk custard buns.

I said priceless with an * because I wanted to explain that it didn't have a price next to the items... Not because there menu is super precious. Boy did I ever experience sticker shock. Yes, I do remember Dynasty is over priced and the food is average here. But when I paid over $10 for three tiny buns...I couldn't help but think: didn't I pay just four dollars for three of these, but slightly larger ones, at Rol San a few weeks ago? 

Okay, so maybe the quality is why it's priced higher, I thought. So after eating amazing Indian food for dinner, I dug into the custard buns. The filing is kinda dry... Atop of this, there's some weird film/coating around the ""custard""/yolk. I assume it's edible, because it's in all three, and I ate it. But if I had to compare it against other custard buns that I've had... I'd much prefer a creamy custard instead of something dried up. I don't think of custards as something dried up ever.

There was a time when the buns were good here... Years ago. Its a shame because the other items in the menu here really are average and over priced.",0
1172,"It was alright, servers very friendly 5/5 food 3/5 wouldn't go out of my way to come back. VERY LOUD.",1
354,"Went last week on Thursday to try their all you can eat Tacos. Nice hand made tortillas. I tried Beef, Carnitas, Pastor and Barbacoa. They were okish, the beef meat wasn't too good. Barbacoa was nice. Very well served with lots of meat. The salsas were in a bottle mild, medium and hot. Not very typical Mexican salsas in terms of flavour and freshness. A friend ordered a slice of Tres leches cake and something was off, the milk on it was not very good tbh so it wasn't eaten. So $19 for all you can eat, 3 tacos first and then one taco at the time. It wasn't completely bad but I doubt I will be back.",1
1605,"Probably 3.5 stars. Overall, this place wasn't bad but I think it's definitely overhyped. It's known for its fresh seafood, namely king crab and lobster. Although you can choose the flavors, the most popular by far is the garlic fried option in which they fry the seafood with tons of garlic and place it on top of a mound of fries. It tasted good, but I feel like by the nature of the dish, it's hard to mess up. 

The staff also seems to be trained to upsell at every opportunity. The waitress persuaded us to order the crab/lobster combo which came with 5 lbs of lobster and 6lbs of king crab. When they came out to show us the live seafood, they claimed that they only had crabs that were 7.5 plus lbs so we would have to pay for the extra weight. 

The meal itself was good but nothing mind blowing. The soup and dessert (which was just macaroons) were very underwhelming. The crab fried rice also tasted kind of plain and didn't have much crab flavor. I did enjoy the garlic fried lobster and steamed crab legs though. 

They automatically add tax and a 10 percent service charge to the bill. They only accept cash and Canadian debit which is crazy considering how pricey the meal is - who carries that much cash around nowadays? You can pay with USD however it will be for an exchange rate slightly lower than market value. 

If you are set on trying this place, it may not hurt to come once. But considering a meal for four was almost 600$ I was expecting something much more memorable.",1
1794,"I am a bit torn by this rating. I would give it a 2.5 if I could. I was a little freaked out my the fruit flies hovering around my table but I put it aside. Hopefully the kitchen is clean, but what can I do about it, nothing. I order two dishes I get at Trizest, a Sichuan place near my home, in Michigan. The Cold Sichuan noodles were good but a bit bland. The portion size of the small would easily feed two. The Ma Po tofu was again, a large portion. It did seem to lack the Sichuan peppercorns and the mouth numbing effect. I'm a fan of salty but it was way salty. I think it was the preserved black beans that put it over the top. My dish didn't come with rice so I had to order some on the side. All in all it was good, but I wouldn't make a pilgrimage here.",1
1829,"Food was ok nothing special. 
The taste was more blend i don't know i thought after reading the reviews it will be a good place but I didn't like the food flavors. 
We ordered a lot of food.
After waiting so long that someone's gonna pick up our order.
To this counts noodle with beef, crispy fried noodles, veggies and dumplings and beef pancake.
Actually I liked the beef pancake and the dumplings.
When we were finished we ordered the bill. 
A lady came with the takeout boxes and then the drama starts I don't know the lady was packing the food and she throws angry the empty plate on the table. 
She got so upset first I thought I gave here to less tip and then I was like no it can't be. 
So she was so angry she went to the other waiters and keep on pointing to our table and she was like angry like no tomorrow. 
I was literally shocked what happen to her.  
Trying to ask but well she didn't speak English.
So I ignored them all of them. 
I don't know maybe she got mad that I couldn't finish my food.
So my advice for this place is nothing special. If you want some waiter getting angry at you for no reason sure go ahead. This place is not recommended from my side.",0
127,"Decided to check this out from Yelp recommendations. When I arrived inside the front door, was greeted right away by the super friendly staff. We proceeded in the back for dining in. The menu had a wide assortment of tacos to choose from, a couple drink options and guacamole. I ordered the quesadillas, the shrimp taco, carnitas and fish taco. Overall the taste of each of the tacos were great, loaded with flavor! The quesadillas was more different then your normal quesadillas, it was quite doughy but was oozing with cheese. I would definitely come back and would recommend to anyone who's looking for some quick tacos and a more quiet atmosphere.",2
1101,Food was mediocre at best I'm sad to say. The pastas and salads were very generic and like I can make that myself at home. Bread was warm which was nice and the atmosphere of both the outside downstairs/upstairs patios and the interior was nice.,1
291,"We ordered takeout from here over the weekend and the food was okay. I would consider it mediocre but for the low price of $3-4 per taco you can't really complain. 

Pros:
Low price
Gluten free options (corn tortillas)

Cons:
Not as flavourful as other tacos I have had. 

In all honestly I thought the value was really good but the flavour could be improved.

I ordered the beef and cactus/mushroom taco. They didn't blow me away but they were pretty good for the low price point. 

Would I return?
If I was in the area and needed a gluten and lactose free meal... sure!",1
1214,"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed.",0
173,"Delicious tacos, horrible sangria. 

Campechano and Seven Lions are the only two ""authentic"" tacos I've had in Toronto, as compared to tacos you can get in the US, particularly as you get close to the Mexican border. At $6-$8 each, they're not cheap, and you'll need between 2-4 to fill you up. 

Avoid the sangria - one of the worst I've had in Toronto.",1
542,"The food was good and the presentation was awesome but I expected it to be more flavourful. 

The place is clearly family run and the service was great because of that. The lady who served me was super sweet.",1
629,Came here because of the lyric in the Drake song and it was a really authentic experience. Would completely recommend it- thanks Drake.,2
937,Very cute and charming restaurant tucked in the Eglinton area. Food was very good - I really enjoyed the duck leg and the beef carpaccio! I like the use of the iPads for menu as well - very convenient and unexpected twist for such a rustic place.,2
1857,"Yum! I've been searching for a place that satisfy my cravings for nice, thick... biang biang noodles!! Great value and taste that's all you need, you gotta eat here.

It's just so inconvenient to make these Xi'an hand pulled noodles at home and hard to find a place in Toronto that delivers thick noodles in the right texture and comforting flavours. Tomato and egg and eggplant is not something you typically find with noodle dishes and just love the tomato/egg as it's a staple comfort food in Chinese cuisine. 

This place has it all in terms of what I look for in a good noodle joint, hand pulled, great flavors, GREAT value and complimentary ingredients. They don't skimp out the veggies or give bad cuts of meat like some places do. Love the pork belly. 

I tried the biang biang and beef rib soup noodle. I say the biang biang is a must try when you first come. Beef rib soup noodle is just not as good.

I also try Liang pi combo, so odd that it comes with specifically orange soda. Is orange soda the best complimentary drink? The meat bun, orange soda and cold noodles all together is only $11~. What a bargain!

Quickly added to my favs!",2
775,"We made resos for a Thursday night. Boy was this place packed! I liked the ambiance but felt like it was too noisy. I liked how it was dimly lit. 
I ordered the duck ravioli. Portion size seemed small. Sauce was good but I felt like it was missing something salty! 
My friend ordered the spicy sausage pasta which was tasty as well. She said it was al dente and the pieces of meat were good. It wasn't too salty or saucy.  
The complimentary bread was mediocre. It was cold and came in a folded paper basket. A small bowl of olive oil was hidden underneath. The olive oil was delishhh though! 
Overall it was alright. Prices are reasonable for the quality. I'm not sure if I'd go back again though!",1
65,"I have driven by this plaza several times, yet I never noticed this small Mexican restaurant until a friend suggested it.

There are only a handful of tables and I noticed they do a lot of take-out orders.  The menus are on chalkboards so it is very easy to read.  We ordered at the cash register, and then found a seat.  We were given complimentary tortilla chips and homemade salsa, which was a nice start.  We ordered two of the Mexican Combos, which consists of one beef chimichanga, one chicken enchilada, rice, salad and beans.  The food was very authentic and fresh.  I thought the beef would have been chunks rather than ground beef though.  My bad for not asking.  

The real star of the meal for me was the horchata.  I have not had once since our vacation in Mexico.  The drink was refreshing, delicious, and very creamy, with the right balance of rice, almonds, various milks and cinnamon.  It is very filling though!  I would definitely order it again.  

I was beyond full, but being a dessert lover, I had to try the caramel flan.  I should have taken it to go, but it looked so delicious.  Mexico Lindo's version is quite different.  The flan is very firm, not jiggly wiggly, and big on flavor!  My husband had only one bite, which is just as well.  I managed to finish it all by myself.

The owner came over and chatted with us, and it is nice to see a family put so much passion into what they do.  

Mexican Combo - $11.95
Horachata - $3.50
Caramel Flan - $6.00",2
1316,"3.5/5
With so many ramen joints in and around Toronto, this place is just another typical ramen joint. I'm really surprised to hear many say this is their favourite ramen.
Remember to join the yelp waitlist during busy hours but service is usually speedy with quick turnarounds in table. 
Approx. $15 per bowl, portions could be larger but there is the option to add extra noodles for a few dollars.",1
1434,"Just prepared that you may wait more than 50 mins for food serving. i came here twice. each time me and my friends will waiting more than 50 mins for food after we ordered. no matter how many customers in here. they are always very slow. even fried rice, they will take that long.

And the fried rice. Are not totally sauced... even it took 50 mins to make.",0
910,"Came here for brunch on Sunday and it was way off the mark. While the ambiance is nice, it was moderately loud and you may be asked to share a table with another group. That didn't bother us really -- the fail point was that they were out of so much stuff and the waitress didn't let us know before we spent a good ten minutes with the menu. No steak. Shoot.

The other failpoint was how their trout brunch menu item is basically like a few bits of fish and citrus. It's definitely not an entree and more of an appetizer. While the waitress did seem to communicate that a tad, I think we definitely expected something different.

The egg dish with the bread was pretty good and tasty and the winner, but portion-wise it also wasn't super filling, but the eggs were perfect. My goat meat focaccia sandwich was decent and tasty -- but I left the meal a bit hungry..I do think maybe we got unlucky with the amount of things they were out of and I do think the chef can cook...I just think the more appetizer-y items should be more clearly labeled and explained.",1
876,"I read a lot of good reviews about Buca and finally decided to give this top 10 restaurants in Canada a try. 

I came here with my girlfriend for dinner. The moment I came in, I felt like my voice was buried in the noisy environment immediately. It was as noisy as a sports bar and not a good place for chatting. My friend and I had to shout really loud at each other. I can't say I enjoyed the ambiance at all.

We ordered the fish salami platter to share, which came with squid ink bread. The bread looked interesting but taste was just average. For the salami, we both liked the octopus. The spicy flavoured pork blood salami was interesting to me too. 

For main, I had the duck pasta and my friend had the lobster pasta. It took us an hour to wait for the main dish though. We saw people sitting next to us got their food first when they came in later. The duck pasta was very chewy and very tasty (though a little bit salty). The duck had a tuna salad texture which was quite interesting. My friend enjoyed the lobster pasta in general but she didn't like the fact that the noodle being too thin and soft (it's personal preference, though I agree with her). The portion of the food was small but good enough to feed two small eaters.

In general, the food quality was good but missed the wow factor.  Service was average and it was a bit pricy for the overall experience. A 3.5 star rounded down. I will not consider coming back any time soon.",1
1012,"Overall a cool place to visit. I had no idea what this place was, until I heard all they hype about it. When I received a gift card for it, I finally decided to check it out. We went on a Sunday afternoon and as expected it was busy. Assuming that there was line ups for the first week it was opened, it wasn't too bad. 

To start off, space itself was modern and vibrant. It was nicely decorated and had a little of everything. There was a supermarket, which kind of wrapped around the whole 2nd floor. From hand made pastas, sauce, cheese and etcs., they had it all. Surrounding the market was a few take out and, dine in restaurants as well, as cafe's and dessert. They also seemed to have classes too! 

The dine in restaurants were of course busy and, there was a wait so we opt'ed out for the take out joints. For the pizza, there was a variety of them but sold out quick (but also seemed like they were made quickly). There was also a take out joint, right when you go up the escalators which, seemed to have a variety of dishes. The gelato was one of my favorite things there and, maybe the best in the city so that's worth giving it a try. The desserts and chocolate, also looked amazing!

Overall, it was a cool experience and, would visit again to try the restaurants and dessert out!",1
295,Can't comment on the food as I NEVER GOT MY ORDER. I ordered a shrimp burrito and waited 30 minutes. I had an appointment so I couldn't wait anymore; I asked the cashier if my order was almost ready and after looking through a pile of past orders I saw him throw the shrimp on the grill. I asked them to forget about it as really had to go. They reimbursed me cash and I left annoyed that I never ate my food and was starving. I'm not sure how they somehow forgot about my order when I was sitting right there in front of them waiting for 30 minutes! I don't think I'll give it another shot...,0
230,"La Carnita remains one of my go-to spots for tacos in Toronto. I love the food here. The only thing I dislike is the wait. There have been times when the wait wasn't very long but it is normally quite long. 

My favorites are:

Mexican Street Corn - The corn is smothered in sauce and it is just so tasty. I highly recommend this item as an appetizer. I get this almost every time I am here. 

In Cod We Trust taco - This remains my favorite. The cod is lightly battered and the vegetables on it go well with it. 

Overall I think La Carnita is a solid spot for Mexican food!",2
153,"If I'm in the mood for no frills authentic tacos, El Trompo is definitely my spot. They range from the classic Al Sador tacos, to a delicious vegetarian option with mushrooms. They also have delicious salsas for you to top your tacos with. While this is definitely not my number 1 taco place, it definitely easily makes the top 5. This is what I imagine at a local taco spot in Mexico!

I've also tried the molten lava cheese pots (cheese with onions, yes please), the cactus salad and the guac. The guac is absolutely delicious, with the tomato adding just the right amount of citrus. Cactus salad, is citrusy and refreshing, a perfect break in between bites of spicy tacos. It has a texture of a cooked squash, and definitely something to try.

If you're looking for an inexpensive, no frills taco spot, with extra offerings, definitely the perfect spot!",2
1080,"I'm still so full writing this review; which is usually a good sign!

The service was good all night, including the full glass of water my boyfriend knocked right off the table that was immediately cleaned up, so that aside:

We started with a bottle of wine, Priorat, which was delicious! About ($100), a great Spanish red, highly recommend.

First came out the calamari ($14) delicious but quite a small portion, more for one person than it was shareable.

I got the Carbonara (basic and $18), it wasn't at all spectacular, in fact it wasn't even memorable. And the portion was not that large either.
My boyfriend got the 8oz ($38) and the cook was perfect, while the star of the dish was the layered potato serving oh my 

Followed up with an Amaretto, and a tiramisu for me (creamy, flavourful, large, filling, delicious!!!) and a caramel something for my boyfriend (also creamy and delicious!)

Highly recommend dessert over everything else we had! It's a cozy place to go after work, but not that impressive really. I'd call a 3.5/5 an accurate rating! 

Pictures attached!!

Will I be back? Unlikely, maybe just for that tiramisu some time",1
1614,"One of the best dumplings  family restaurant!!! 
We visited the place about 6 years ago and were super impressed with the food. That was the first time ever I've tried dumplings.
In October we were in Toronto and decided to visit this place again. We are still impressed with deliciousness and quality of the food. We ordered several different dishes and they all have been made for us from scratch -- handmade dumplings  are sooooo goooood!!!! If you are in town, make sure stop by that amazing family restaurant!!!!!!!!",2
544,"Almost gave it two stars (read to find out more) but the one thing I can't get over is serving an alcoholic drink to someone who specified ""virgin"", when you delivered it to the table she checked again that it was ""virgin"", you agree verbally it had no alcohol, she tries some, tastes alcohol and then you go -- ""Oooh actually this one is the virgin"".  Sure, if she was pregnant or on medication or driving, maybe the sip of alcohol wouldn't be *that* big a deal.  But if she was recovering alcoholic, that one sip could literally change her life, and it's up to you as a business to be honest and knowledgeable about what you're serving.

Things that were terrible:
- we had a reservation, they called us to confirm it was for 700 pm, show up, they say oops we thought 730 pm, they literally have to move people from their seats to accommodate us
- during the 45 minute wait for all this to take place, they took drink orders from us multiple times, but never served us drinks
- they dropped an entire plate of steaming hot chicken fajitas on the ground, it splashed boiling sauce all over people, and their clothes as well
- when i went over to the owner at this point to say - now that we are covered in fajita sauce - can we please have the drinks we keep trying to order? she made a HUGE stink about it, just immediately responded, ""We didn't do any of this on purpose, do you understand? We are doing our best"" and then going to every member of my party reiterating that, as though I had done some rude injustice to her, it was super embarrassing and unprofessional
- drinks still took an extra hour and they weren't good
- they served the birthday girl fajitas with no tortillas or sides, just the meat (she didn't ask for that modification)
- the food was so awful my poor fiance actually sent his BACK -- and this is a guy who complains about NOTHING
- bills took over an hour after asking MULTIPLE times
- the place was so warm they had to keep opening the front door to let in cool air

It almost got 2 stars because they did pay the dry cleaning bill for the jacket that was covered in fajitas sauce, but honestly, I can't forgive the alcohol incident.  This whole experience was stressful and awful. I have no idea why they took our reservation (none of us had been there before), we were clearly too big a group for them at 700 (or 730..or 800...depends who you ask) on a Saturday!",0

Inside is pretty packed. Our table was next to the washroom lol

778,"Very spacious restaurant, a bonus for downtown foodies. 
The location used to be a bank, so the architecture inside is unique, interesting, and stunning.
(Be sure to visit washrooms and vaults in the bsmt.) 

The menu is not typical Italian, which was a bit disappointing for my group of 7, and they're not open to substitutions for dietary / halal purposes. 

Our server was very insistent about what we should and shouldn't apply cheese to, a quick suggestion would've been nice - but then let ppl eat how they want to!

Food was a bit bland, although their tomato sauce tastes fresh and authentic. The fresh cut hot peppers they bring to the table saved our meals. 
*Be prepared to cut the uncooked basil on the Margherita pizza yourself ‍ it's just placed uncooked in the center.  

Desserts are a different story, very nice presentation and the taste was even better! The Tiramisu & Creme Caramel were a nice end to a mehh unexciting lunch. 

Not a lot of veggie/salad/vegan options for those who have medical / religious restrictions. 
But if you're into fusion menus and meat in everything  - this is definitely a great place to go for that.",0
852,"You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life... at Fieramosca.  (You are old like me if you know that theme song!)

Have you ever gone to a restaurant with great expectations based on reviews and left disappointed?  That was our experience.

Some call it cozy but for me the table layout in the main dining room is claustrophobically cramped.  If you want a seat on the patio on Friday or Saturday in the summer, make sure to reserve several days in advance.

Reservations are taken by phone and I will admit they were very helpful even if it did take 10 rings for them to answer... I was surprised that a restaurant in this price range did not have online reservations!

Being in a house transformed into a restaurant, the entry hallway is narrow, so if someone is going out, nobody can go in and vice versa.  

So if you are even a little claustrophobic,  be warned, you won't be comfortable here.  

The food:

Complimentary bruschetta:  A plain Pizza crust with bruschetta topping which falls off and wasn't that flavourful. Go to La Bruschetta to find out how it is meant to taste.

Caesar salad:  Crispy romaine, hints of fresh garlic and Parmesan but the dressing seemed watery and the croutons were like rocks.

Bread basket:  Now I know why the croutons are like rocks, the crust on the bread was so hard I was worried I would break a tooth, and I also found it strange to be served whole wheat bread, when I was expecting crusty Italian bread.  

Spaghetti Carbonara:   The reason we came was because Hubby was craving Carbonara and based on great reviews we thought we would try it here but he found Fieramosca's version disappointingly bland, even with extra Parmesan cheese and fresh ground pepper.  

Linguini DI Mamma Ninetta:  I love mushrooms but was surprised that there were so many in this dish... With just 3 small shrimp and a few small pieces of chicken scattered throughout, and very little garlic flavour, this dish was edible but far from great.

Tiramisu:  No coffee flavour!  I have made Tiramisu before and have had it in countless restaurants and I know the lady fingers are to be dipped in coffee before being covered in cream, and these missed the coffee altogether, and the cream here seemed to just be whipped cream, none of the yummy marscapone that I was expecting.   Libretto's Tiramisu in a jar might not be traditional in presentation but has all the flavour that Fieramosca's lacked.  My favourite dessert when done well, I left disappointed.

Lemon Sorbet:  Frozen sorbet in a scooped out lemon, menu says imported from Italy.  I actually liked it better than the sad face Tiramisu so hubby swapped with me because while he usually loves anything lemon, he found an odd aftertaste.  I joked it was the jet fumes to bring frozen sorbet from Italy but the truth is, it was the perfume worn by the woman at the table next to ours.  Thankfully she arrived as we had dessert, so our entire meal was not ruined, but the smell was so overpowering that it gave us both a headache and we wanted to get out of there fast, since with the cramped layout she was almost on top of our table.

Ladies, please don't drown yourself in perfume and go to a restaurant!  Ugh!

TL;DR - Meh. Bottom line nothing was horrible but nothing was great, which for the price was disappointing.  Not worth a second visit.

2 stars bumped to 3 because the service was good.

The search for Pasta Carbonara continues... maybe a trip to NYC or even Rome!",1
53,"$16 dollars for the worst burrito bowl/platter ever, are you friggin kidding me. Maybe because it was take out but that's hardly an excuse.

This little spot is located on St.Claire W and it doubles as a Butcher shop. I walk in and it smells amazing! I love pork tacos and since I can cook all other tacos I decided to get the Carnitas and El pastor. I was so excited and 2 of the saddest looking tacos were brought over. 

Now, looks are not everything so I decided to take a bite. Even though the tacos were super plain I figured if the meat is super flavourful I won't need any sauces. The meats were very chewy, at one point I felt like I was eating leather. Most of the Pork had gooey fat all over it and I just wasn't a fan. I added cilantro, onions and the extra spicy sauce which helped with flavour but the meat was a big issue for me. 

Keep Eating,

Service: 3 Stars
Ambience: 4 Stars
Fill Factor: Satisfied

While looking for some good Italian food on College street we stumbled onto this restaurant. When we entered there were about 5 empty tables but according to the hostess they were all reserved. They did manage to squeeze us in though but many groups were turned away during our time there. So I'd you plan to come here it may be a good idea to reserve a table in advance.

Once we were seated we ordered the gnocchi gorgonzola, rigatoni Bolognese, and Stracciatella soup. Let me start off by saying the gnocchi was great. The texture was great and the sauce was nice and creamy. However do note that the sauce was a little bitter so maybe the rosee sauce would be a better choice in this case. I tried a bit of the rigatoni and it was delicious. Loved the sauce. Finally we tried the Stracciatella soup which had shredded chicken and egg drop. It was our first time trying it and it was perfect for the weather that day.

The service was alright here. The servers were friendly but they were really busy so there was no further interaction after they brought our food until we asked for the bill.

The restaurant itself was nice and comfortable. It is not a very big space but it never felt cramped.

I am glad we tried this place out. We enjoyed the food very much and I would love to come back here to try the pizzas next time.",2
1352,"Food: 4/5
Service: 3.5/5
Decor: 3/5
Price: 4/5

Small and quaint. When entering there was a sign warning about bugs that may look like cockroaches inside the restaurant. It says to not be alarmed they are not cockroaches and it is natural during the summer days for these little insects to find their way indoors. If spotted you can call a waiter to come by and they will sweep them up and take them outdoors. 

The menu's are suuuuper dirty. They do not wipe them down at all! There's tons of grit and its sticky on all 3 of our menu's. The pricing wasn't too clearly shown. For the main's its all the same price located at the very top $16.95 and then you can add on your different meats for a dollar or 2 on top. 

We got two appetizers the garlic shrimp and the fried chicken. They were both delicious!. For the mains the green curry was okay, we got it with beef. Big mistake, their beef is extremely tough! it was super dry, felt like it's been cooked for days and kept in the fridge to be warmed up in a microwave and tossed into the curry to serve. The 3 flavours pad thai was good. had a lot of flavour and ingredients as well. The best out of the 3 was the Khao Soi, i got that one with chicken. Delicious. No complaints. 

We let the waitress know about the really tough beef and she just took the dish and brought it to the kitchen without saying a word. After a few minutes she came back and said she would switch the curry to chicken instead. We agreed and she took the plate back inside. It was a pretty busy night so taking awhile for the food to come out is understandable. I shared the Khao Soi and waited for the green curry to come out. By the time we finished our food it finally came. We just asked for it to-go. 

The service i would say is about a 3.5, she seemed as though she was just rushing through everything without talking with the customers. Food took quite a while as well. I would go back to try their other menu items.",1
231,"Stopped here for an after dinner snack and ended up sharing and app and a couple tacos with friends. Not much to say since we were here for a short time, but the food was definitely tasty!",1

Improvement.
Would function better if customers paid at front, took a number and had a seat.
Doesn't need waiters, slows it down.",2
646,"Came here for a friend's birthday dinner, but was only able to stay for a glass of wine and some appetizers. The service is swanky; waiters are able to explain the menu quite extensively, and ours took the craft of wine very seriously (uncertain whether he was a sommelier). There were certain parts in the night where service, however, was surprising and poorer than expected. May I also mention that their website menu isn't up to date? Makes it difficult for a foodie to choose beforehand!

We started with a bunch of appetizers, listed below.

Charcuterie & Cheese Board
We chose an array of five different meats and cheeses, which came served with three different preserves. It was, quite frankly, very shocking that the board didn't come with any bread or crackers. When prompted and asked, the server point blank asked if we'd like to order the light fried bread (gnocco fritto) to go with the cheeses - for another $10! It therefore felt a bit cheap that they wouldn't even offer a bit of bread to accompany the salty cheese and charcuterie. As such, our experience of the board was a bit lacking; it was a little difficult to finish the remnants of the cheese.
We were told that the cured elk is very unique; Baro and one other restaurant in Western Canada are the sole providers of this elk. The elk certainly tasted interesting! The spices used made it taste like gingerbread and Christmas. Haha! A crowd favourite was the spicy salami (salsiccine), though my favourites were the leaner meats... Unfortunately, can't remember their names!
With regards to cheese, we only hoped that there was some bread. That said, everyone had their distinct preferences. I like milder cheeses, and so enjoyed the parmigiano.

Nodini 
This app probably offered the highest value with regards to quantity / price. There were roughly 12 knots, which were flavourful, warm, and had a nice crunch. My only criticism is that they could have been a little softer (I found them a little dense and dry) and they were swimming in a touch too much olive oil.

Parmigiana di Melanzane
This was my favourite appetizer of the evening! The fried eggplant was lightly breaded and wonderfully crisp. The tomato sauce with the tanginess of the ricotta was super delicious and addicting! The appetizer is quite small for its price point, and so we got 2 to share among the 6 of us.

We also ordered two bottles of red wine... It was really nice! Unfortunately I forgot the name, but it was quite medium/full-bodied, without any harsh acidity or dryness, and went down smoothly. The rest of the party continued to order mains and desserts, but I had to leave early.

I was surprised to hear that they don't separate bills - as such, I had to do the math first and pay my part separately. How interesting! I also appreciated the Italian cookie given as a takeaway favour. The amaretti cookie was chewy and doughy, and had a wonderful almond flavour. I loved it!

Overall, I found Buca to be quite pricey with very small portions. Would I go again? Probably not, unless there was a special function of sorts!",2
1134,"A decent spot for family style Italian food. The food is not very exquisite but doesn't taste too bad either. Pasta was great but other dishes were just okay. 

Beef carpaccio: very salty and oily. Part of the beef tasted frozen. There was also a sharp bitter taste in the bites. It's supposed to be made with truffle oil but I couldn't taste any truffle.  

Veal piccata: very mediocre family style dish 

Smoke duck angelhair: the pasta was very delicious! Perfectly cooked and favoured with lots of toppings. The smoke duck was delicious too.",1
83,"CASH ONLY!!! & the location is kind of odd and the place is super tiny! But through it all the tacos are delicious....

All tacos are 6 bucks each. 

I ordered 2 tacos and was super full! I got the smoked marlin taco and the camarones a la diabla.

The camarones a la diabla was so fire!!! All the flavors were perfect. The marlin taco was not bad but a little on the drier side. Def would recommend the camarones a la diabla!

I tried the HOT salsa - and I like spicy but this was reallllly spicy! Good flavor tho but just an FYI for those daring souls.

I did not like that they didn't have small cups for salsa and you had to put your salsa straight on your taco. It's some what unsanitary from my perspective.",2
1075,"A last minute decision as we were staying at Delta Toronto a 2 minute walk from our hotel!

955,"A hidden gem, that I hope will stay hidden for a little longer until I get my fill. Is that a terrible thing to say? 

With their limited seating and limited hours of operation, you have to plan your visit at Famiglia Baldassare. I decided to trek over on a random Tuesday I was home, a little sick and miserable. 
I got there around 12:10, and all the seats were full, and there was a small group of people waiting for their take out. I got to order right away (one of two pastas on the board) and it was about a 10-15 min for the food.

As I waited, I watched them roll out sheets of pasta, work on dough, and just working in unison in the open kitchen - it was mesmerizing. 
I can't remember what I had, but I attached a picture. I don't think you can go wrong trying every item on their menu - seriously. The pasta was perfectly al dente, lightly sauced and simply delightful!

786,"I've always found Terroni (and some other similar Italian restaurants) slightly overpriced for the food, but I quite enjoyed my dinner here recently. My bill was almost $40 for a main and two apps split among 5 people, but I left quite satisfied and full.

We started off with the beef carpaccio and grilled calamari for the table. I wasn't the biggest fan of the carpaccio, which was thinly sliced raw beef served with spicy arugula and shaved cheese, drizzled with lemon juice. The contrast of the smooth beef, rich cheese, and harsh bite of the arugula was an interesting combination. I did, however, love the grilled calamari! The portion size was mediocre; there were only about three small pieces there. That said, it was grilled to a nice crisp and char, and was so flavourful! I enjoyed that it was also served on a leafy bed of greens with tomatoes, making it a nice and light starter.

My main was the Spaghetti in Canna al Mare - a tomato based spaghetti topped with different seafood such as clams, mussels, calamari, and shrimp. I was very pleasantly surprised at how generous they were with the toppings. My plate had lots of calamari and roughly 8 mussels/clams, along with two meaty shrimps. I wouldn't say that the seafood is very fresh, but the slightly spicy and tangy tomato sauce helped add some flavour and depth. The portions are actually a decent size too - I was unable to finish mine, but fortunately a friend pitched in and helped!

My friend ordered a pizza, and although I forget which one he got, I distinctly remember him asking the server for the one with the most meat (guys will forever be guys). I sampled a small bite, and it was pretty good! There's a fair amount of cheesy goodness on top, and the crust is super thin. There's a nice crunch when you bite into it. Our main complaint is that the pizza arrives uncut - and you're expected to use your fork and knife to manage.

On that note, keep in mind that Terroni doesn't really allow for substitutions or modifications (e.g., doesn't accommodate no cheese or sub cheese requests), and that extends towards asking for their pizza cut. Although my experience here was quite lovely, though I believe there are plenty other Italian places in the city to visit and will be unlikely to return anytime soon!",2

The low sloping ceiling creates a cozy atmosphere that makes you forget you're on busy College Street. The entire staff was warm, inviting, and knowledgeable.

If you're in a party if 2-3 and want to try a variety of dishes, they offer smaller sizes of most dishes. If you're unsure what to order, simply tell them any dietary restrictions and your budget, and they will gladly curate a tasting menu for you.

We ordered 6 items, 3 of which were adjusted to smaller portions. Favourite dishes were the grilled scallops and grilled skirt steak. For a good time, dip that steak in the scallops' butter sauce.",2
1650,"Let me first say that I was walking into this restaurant expecting to give this place a 4-star (if not 5-star review). I was skeptical of the reviews that rated this place under 4-stars because of raving reviews from co-workers of mine. However, that co-worker went to this place the Friday before I came and also deemed the quality has declined. So maybe it is worthwhile reading on my review as to why that's the case.

My friend and I ordered three things so i'll describe each item below- starting with the best.

1. Green beans- if all the other food was as good as this one, I would've given this place a 4-star review. Fresh, flavorful, and on-point. The wringly green beans stir-fried into the peppers and mushrooms were fantastic. However, this was a very small plate for it to cost $11. Quality: 4.5/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5.

2. Fried rice- this was their featured fried rice and a recommendation from the co-worker. I'm not a fried rice person to begin with but chose this because of the rec. This was just fried rice I could get at any chinese restaurant in chinatown for probably 75% of this cost. It was a lot but not memorable. Quality: 3.5/5. Price for the food amount: 4/5 

3. Boiled pork and chive dumplings- having chosen the healthier version of the dumpling options (versus fried), these turned out to be the most disappointing meal here. The dough/skin of the dumpling was very thick (and this is my greatest fear). The ratio of meat to skin was probably 1:2.5. Quality: 2/5. Price for the food amount: 3/5. You can get the same dumplings but WAYYYYYY better at dumpling house in Chinatown. Thank me later and go there.

So in conclusion, if you're looking for the hype of this place that came from BlogTO or other reviewers, this place will not meet your standards. I would go elsewhere for chinese food- specifically Chinatown; unless you want the aesthetics and hip vibe, then this place got that nailed down.",1

The food here is amazing. All the pastas and pizzas are made fresh and so full of flavor. The salads are so tasty and filled with all fresh ingredients. The staff are super friendly and the owner is absolutely fantastic!!! 
I would highly recommended you to eat here anytime!!! It's perfect :)",2
1106,"Best crab ravioli & grilled calamari I've ever had! Friends ordered the veal marsala, a chicken special and fettuccine cream (don't remember the names) and they were flavourless. The restaurant is too cramped so it's hard to enjoy a meal without bumping elbows into the servers. Service however was really good. Would come back just for the ravioli & calamari.",1
608,"I ordered a cappuccino with lenticchie while my friend ordered the mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta. I sampled her food as well so I will share my thoughts.

Cappuccino was okay. It was a nice and quick pick me up after work. Lenticchie was average.The lentils were flavoured with crispy salami, pachino tomatoes and zucchini. I couldn't taste the zucchini but the rest was nicely flavoured.

Mushroom bruschetta and panna cotta was Michu better in comparison. Mushroom bruschetta was nice and crunchy. The mushrooms were flavoured nicely and brought out a lot of its natural flavours. The panna cotta has a citrusy taste and a really great summer treat!

Servers were quick to refill waters and to check if we were doing okay. Price point is fairly high for what we ordered but will come back to try the pasta.",1
1213,"I never fully understood the taco genre but my life changed when I had the Baja fish taco. Best taco I've ever had in my life. I think of it often. 

I also had the Pulpo a la Mexicana (octopus), which was also good but I definitely don't love eating octopus in a taco. Biting into a taco with crispy fish is just more satisfying than something chewy, y'know?

A warning to those who are visiting for the first time, there is almost no sitting room in this place so be prepared to bring your tacos elsewhere to eat.

Love this place.",2
1054,"La Vecchia is a cute restaurant with great ambiance near Yonge & Eglinton. It is filled with wooden tables and twinkle lights. 

The service is great. We didn't make a reservation for dinner but snagged a spot at the bar. Both the bartender and our server checked in with us frequently. Our water was constantly filled up and we were asked if we desired further drinks throughout the experience. 

While the food was good, it was simply average. We had the penne alla vodka (gluten free) and the capricciosa pizza. Unfortunately, only a handful of the pasta options could be made gluten free, and none of the pizza could be made gluten free. This was fairly limiting. 

There are various delicious Italian restaurants in the area and unfortunately this one simply didn't stack up (both in taste and gluten free options). I would certainly come back for drinks (I had a delicious Aperol spritz) but would likely not come back for the food.",1
717,"My boyfriend and I used to go to Trattoria Nervosa all the time, it closed down a couple of times for ""renovations"" so we havent been in a while. We just ordered from them after they opened up post-COVID era and were supremely disappointed with the food. The prices stayed the same but the portions were significantly smaller and the crust for the pizza wasnt as good as it used to be. You used to be able to smell truffles when you walked in the restaurant, I couldnt even taste them at all on the pizza. They also got rid of the beef carpaccio and the risotto nervosa which were a couple of our favourite dishes! :(",0
769,"The decor was nice and the staff were all very friendly and helpful but it was a veeeery long wait for our main course. I had the Tagliatelle special with sausage, mushroom and black truffles and it was ok, I wasn't that impressed. I wouldn't order it again. But others at my table enjoyed their meals.",1
1826,"Went there with my husband on a Saturday night, and noticed that they don't have many tables for 2-4 people. So you basically have to wait until a table is available. They do have seats on 2 levels. 
The Chinese food was average, nothing special. It's a little bit over priced compared to the other Chinese restaurants that's in the area.",1
566,Had to check this place out after my friends raved about its authenticity. Staff and servers are warm and welcoming. We ordered take out and didn't have to wait too long. I had the chicken tacos which I found to be dry. May have to try the beef ones next time.,1
1643,"Service is very good...friendly ambiance but I'm sorry, I just did not taste the authentic chinese food that I want.  Maybe they are just giving a modern twist but not for me.  Also, the meat are so thinly sliced for the price it should have more than that.  It just my taste and maybe some people will not agree.",1
1094,"My group and I came here to celebrate a birthday. There were issues with the reservation, as they had only called to confirm the day of the event, and we found we weren't being treated appropriately because of it by the hostess/first waiter upstairs that we received. It also may have been because of young age compared to the rest of their customers. If you plan to visit, make reservations and make sure there are no miscommunications before arriving. 

They ended up being able to accommodate us and our new waiter downstairs was very friendly and helpful. Despite the service in the beginning, it was quickly turned around with good service and great food. I ordered the gnocchi and it was delicious and filling. 

This place felt more like a date spot than a spot for large parties, there are a few floors, but it's still small. The food would be 5/5 for me but with the initial service, had to give it a 3.",1
491,"I went here because it was virtually the only option when I did a search for birria in Toronto. Unfortunately, when I got there at 10am, they didn't have the goat birria ready yet, so I had to have beef instead. I'll try not to hold that against them. It was good enough that I'm hoping to return for the goat. Super tender, and fresh and hot.

Downsides are that the tortillas aren't as fresh (not bad, but not obviously handmade), and the broth for the birria is more of a salty tomato base than a drinkable mole. But it's still excellent quality for what it is.",2
1353,"Been here multiple times 

The staff here is very hospitable.

The aburi is what makes Miku Miku. A process of torching sushi. The ingredients are fresh and the pairing is great. 

I like coming here for their cooked items as well. The dessert is a must !

Shout out to Dan the server for his service and recommendations. Hope to see you soon when restaurants open up again.

I heard they have takeout. I haven't tried it yet.",2
960,"Went there on Dec. 31st at lunchtime and lineup was ridiculously long. We had to wait two hours before we were able to sit down. Having said that, I would say that the wait is worth it, as the pasta is really at a whole another level, better than any other place I've tried in Toronto (and even Italy as a matter of fact). 

We had the tagliatelle with the ragu sauce and the spinach/ricotta ravioli with the blanco sauce (with truffle and parmagiano cheese). Both dishes were amazing, however, the true outstanding item on their menu that day was the Fior Di Latte: the mozzarella ball was prepared in the morning of the same day. We also ordered the Parma ham appetizer (cured in house for 16 months), which was also good, but nothing to write home for...

All in all, I highly recommend this place, but just  don't go hungry, as you will have to wait for a long time (There is only sitting room for 10 people inside). My only complaint about this place is their opening hours, they are only open for lunch four days a week (and sadly, they are not open on the werk",2
874,"The entrance was a bit hard to find, since there was no door / entrance off of the main street (where the restaurant's address was). You need to go into the Four Seasons Hotel area, turn left, and it's the last door by the fence (it's right across from the side entrance of Four Seasons Hotel). There's no obvious sign indicating where the restaurant is, until you actually get to in front of the door.

The food tastes good, but nothing too special. Portion sizes of the pasta are a bit on the small side. The vegetable sides are quite good and rightly portioned. Service is attentive and just like in any other higher-class restaurants.",1
1657,"I give this place 3.5 stars.

This little neighbourhood hole-in-the-wall is one major black west of Chinatown proper. I like the industrial minimalist decor and the open-concept kitchen - which means you can hear the comforting sounds of food being prepared and cooked.

The menu is simple - not the 10-page ones you get at the authentic Chinese restaurants like Asian Legend. It seems they've decided just to focus on the crowd-pleaser items.

We ordered the chilli fish and the beef noodle soup. Both dishes came to the table piping hot. The chilli fish is a medium-sized plate of lightly battered, small fish fillets with a nice kick - I give it 4 stars. The beef noodle soup is a big bowl filled with (mostly) tender pieces beef, thick spaghetti-like noodles, what looked like bak choy and broth that also has a kick - I give it 3.5 stars.

The young wait staff seem eager - which is good. (Perhaps some of the more authentic Chinese restaurants like Kwan - at Yonge-St. Clair -  should have some of their waiters get pointers from Chop Chop.)

I would go back for the chilli fish.",1
1828,"This was our first Chinatown experience and it left much to be desired. I'll start by saying that the menu is extensive, with over 160 items to choose from. Perhaps we didn't order the best dishes.

We ordered the soup dumplings with crab meat and pork, which were the highlight of the night. Both the Sui Mai and the chicken and cabbage potsticker, which were on special, did not hit home. They were both bland and could have used some salt. The last dish, stir fried Ho Fun with beef was good but the beef had an interesting texture, it had no chew and fell apart in your mouth. I'd say the noodles had good flavour but could have been better.

To sum up, the food was good. It wasn't great, it wasn't bad... it was good. The service was great. Food came quickly and servers were always nearby. If I do come back to this location, the soup dumplings are the only thing that I will be ordering again.",1
372,"3.5 stars to some more great options of 4 stars.  Not going to lie... it's true Kensington in every sense of the neighbourhood.

If you're willing to look past the rough and gritty exterior, you may find some good tacos here.  Nothing risked is nothing gained and I feel that La Chilaca Taqueria fits that perfectly.  It's in the 'food court' of several Latin American food stalls.  Food court is an understatement... It's more like a disheveled, heavily worn and dirty open non A/C store that has every stall spilling out into a small room.  It shares the space with 3 other stalls.  

There are some tables in the back of the dingy place but there's a weird smell emanating from the back as you sit beside several broken old unused glassed counters.  On a crazy hot day, the lack of A/C makes this insane and feel like an oven.  The open back door to a few more seats barely helps.  The 'kitchen' is really a small stove top and a crammed setting of a kitchen sink and a counter to assemble.  

You're quickly greeted and told to look up at the menu.  There are daily deals like 2 chorizo tacos for $5 or 4 other tacos for $10.  Each taco is $5 each regardless of the type.  When we went, the carnitas werent ready but they had 8 other ones you could try.  Service here is efficient but I have to admit they were all busy with the World Cup... can't blame them since the entire Kensington (let's be real... Toronto) is watching.  I do have to worry a bit when we overheard the person in the kitchen saying how can they cook this chicken in under 3 minutes... ehhhh wut?  How about cooking it till it's done?

I have to admit the addition of their sauces really perked these up so grab some before taking a bite into them.  The creamy orange one has some good heat that could make you water up a bit if you're not careful.  I wasnt expecting that type of heat and wow, yeah... ice cream was needed to cool my tongue.  What I thought would be the spicy red transparent sauce was actually a tomato one that didn't have any heat and just added a little bit of flavour.  There was also a nice vibrant green sauce that was very good mix of mild jalalpeno, onions, and cilantro.  Totally refreshing to add.

Fish Taco - My favourite of the tacos.  The fish pan fried and still tender without being dried out.  This was a stuffed taco... the type where you take a bite and you realize that the sauce and pickled onions are just going to be exploding soon.  The sauce just oozes out onto your hand and you're soon licking your fingers.  The cilantro just gives a nice freshness to it... I know, not everyone likes cilantro but it's good on this one.  Another thing I love about this... they double wrap the taco so they dont fall apart easily AND they toast the corn tortilla up so they're a bit crispy.  Nice one. 4/5 

Vegetable Taco - Soooo I keep ordering Vegetable Tacos and I keep wondering why afterwards.  My search for a good one continues but I learned that tofu and cheese really doesn't work... at... all.  I feel like you do one or the other.  It's just a weird combination.  In addition to those, they had cilantro, pickled onion, and tomatoes. This one wasn't as flavourful so it really benefits from either the orange hot sauce (that will scorch you) or green fresh herb one.  3/5

Chorizo Taco - Another solid taco with the paprika giving the pork a nice flavour.  It was cooked fresh from the sausage and it didnt taste like it was standing in some pot for a few hours.  They garnished with pickled onions and cilantro and helped cut through the rich meat.  I was told this was authentic to the style in Mexico city.  4/5  

Beef Taco - Maybe I wasn't in the mood for cheese but the beef and cheese one didn't quite work.  As generous as they were with the cheese... I just felt this one was really quite heavy and a bit oily.  The beef was possibly a bit overcooked which made it a bit on the dry side.  I could have added more sauce to it but something didn't quite work as well as the chorizo.  3/5

Shrimp Taco - This was a solid one with small shrimps cooked fairly well.. they werent rubbery or dried out.  Just a nice juicy chew.  They added a spice to it that kept it out of the bland side ... though I have to admit, this wasn't as flavourful as the Chorizo.  This one does work well with a sauce to keep it from being boring.  They did garnish with the usual pickled onions and cilantro.  3.5/5

There are some really good tacos coming out of here and made freshly with some in house made sauces that really make the tacos pop.  BUT if you're the type where you're concerned about atmosphere, this might put you off.  Worse case, you can take it to go and eat it while you're walking about Kensington but just bring a few napkins, ok a lot... cause you're going to be leaving a trail of food dripping otherwise!",1
666,"A difficult review to write... have had Agio bookmarked for a long time. 

Pitched it for my work lunch and because everyone trusted me Agio was booked. 

There were a few changes in numbers but the day before I did confirm 9 people with a birthday celebration. 

We arrive to a chilly empty restaurant at 12pm hungry and ready to try delicious pasta. 

We sit and ariund 1215pm i order calamari, trio bruschetta and cauliflower fritters to start. Half of us were there and the other half trickled in. The latest person arrive and we order entrees around 1240pm. 

At 115pm is when we first start to get appetizers. The friendly owner was the only one taking care of tables and cooking. 

Our entrees came around 145pm. The difficulty is that not everyone has a 2 hour lunch. The birthday girl ended up having to leave with no entree just apps because she had an appointment at 2pm. 

We finally wrapped up the meal around 215 with creme brulee on the house, the owner made it specifically for us the might before. 

I liked the apps, amuse bouche of squash stuff grilled zucchini. My spicy tomato spaghetti was delicious and pasta was fresh. 

The chef reminded us this several times that his food is made fresh. 

We ended up being the only table the whole time, off the lunch menu the meatballs werent available and half the table didnt love their entrees. Not 4.5 stars love anyways. 

Disappointing because I felt like the chef should have had someone come in to help or tell us the calamari cant be ordered becausr of the work behind it. Turned out chewy which was unfortunate. 

Just wish there was more communication. It was quite embarrassing for me to be responsible for a mediocre hangry people filled lunch :(

I was still defending the restaurant the next week... ill go back to try with a smaller group. 

It does have character I just don't think it was a good mix for a large group that didn't have 2.5 hrs for lunch.",1
1831,"Been getting our Chinese BBQ takeout here for years. Great BBQ duck, chicken and Cha Siu BBQ pork.",2
1767,"Tried the Dim Sum at dinner time- the quality leaves much to be desired although the food was hot and served with typical efficient minimalist ( they did top up your tea promptly) service. The Xiao long bao was completely dry; Char siew bao was dry and flakey ( below expectations). Pricey for the lack of quality.

Saw that they had Tiger beer which was a pleasant surpise 

We probably won't be coming back again .",0
453,"I've been anticipating this restaurant to open since I saw the coming soon signs. Recently opened, I dined in to check it out.

Food: They have a selection of rotisserie chicken (pollo rostizado), gourmet tacos and street tacos. They also have imported Mexican soda (grapefruit, pineapple and other flavours). If you sit in, they give you complimentary nachos and salsa verde! I tried the 1/4 chicken which came with broiled potatoes and three tortillas. The chicken was the star of the plate, it is juicy inside and held a pack of sweet and savoury flavour. 
I left the pescado (fish) street taco for last, it came with two pieces of battered fish, onion, cilantro and one tortilla. I guess I left it out too long, as the fish was not buttery and moist inside. 

Service & atmosphere: The staff are friendly and as I was a first timer they explained the items on their menu. If you want to know more about the food, they'd be glad to share their origins. The murals along the walls are painted with beautiful detail, I could not take my eyes off them.

Price: The 1/4 chicken plate and fish taco was $13.27 altogether. Leaving with a full stomach on that price seems fair to me. The next time I come back, will try the gourmet tacos. This restaurant is a welcomed addition to Roncesvalles!",2
891,"What's happening Buca? Is expansion over quality influencing the dishes.

Was staying in the area for an occasion and decided to head here for desert here after dinner at The One at Hazelton Hotel. We ordered 3 desert dishes, including their tiramisu. Can't say I was impressed. 

Service as usual was great.

You also can't choose toppings either, I'm pretty sure all the burritos comes with the same thing (rice + peppers and onions) Again, tasted good didn't mind that at all but I think my extreme hunger made it taste a lot better, if that makes any sense. I probably won't be back but glad I got to try this place out!!! Maybe if I had tried the tacos my opinion would be different but you can def find better taco places I'm sure",1
995,"Eating at Eataly is a mission and a half. 
Starting with the half mission, parking. Looking for public parking or street parking was a disaster. Found out after, I could have parked at the Manulife centre and received a 2 hour parking voucher if $50 was spent at Eataly, located upstairs, which was validated by reception, located on the main level. Yes, that's the process. Wild. 

That was the half mission - on to the full mission. In addition to navigating to find Eataly from the streets, you'll have to navigate to the Manulife Centre then up to the second floor. Here, you'll have to navigate through hoards of people, waiting in line or casually roaming around. Once you've done a full walk and decided where to eat, it's another 1-2 hour wait for a table at your desired restaurant. Tip. Do it the reverse way. Go to the restaurant and make your reservation THEN roam around. 

Finally, on to the food review. 
I chose La Piazza. Three items. 

Mozzarella ball. This was 4/5. It was soft and fresh as expected. Sprinkled with olive oil and salt. 

Mushroom pizza. 2/5. Basic pizza. I know. While consuming, I had a feeling I've had better at a mom and pop local pizza shop.

Penne. 3/5. Average. Nothing special to say. It was al dente - which was advertise. 

Verdict. Would I return? No. So much hype for no reason. Crowded beyond belief. 

However, if you made it this far, please try the cannoli - it made the trip worth it. They offered classic cow milk. They do offer the traditional sheep milk, it's definitely an acquired taste. These were 5/5.

I also forgot to mention. Eataly does offer fresh pasta and the freshest vegetables I have ever seen.",1
1085,"Came for dinner on a Friday night with a girlfriend before a night out. Your typical downtown core restaurant. The vibe is casual because it's near the CN Tower, Skydome & ACC; everyone's in their game gear & it's really loud inside.

Service is fine, nothing really stood out to me - pretty standard job. It took a bit longer than I'd hoped for our food to come out, but it was kind of busy since the jays game was starting/ending. We were also really hungry while waiting, so it might've felt longer.

The food tasted pretty good! I got a seafood linguine, even though I don't normally like to work for my food but the mussels were awesome. I got an okay portion size - slightly lacking in noodles, but my friend got the egg yolk carbonara and it was actually so small, I felt bad. I don't really think it was worth the price of the dish because of the small sizes.

Overall, I probably wouldn't come back. There are better places to get pasta that might be just a bit farther of a walk.",1
658,"This place is a hidden gem and the prices are great! It looks like the restaurant needs some renovation, but don't be fooled by the interior, the food here is great!

Service:

The owner is very friendly and welcoming. He is the chef as well. The service was attentive and the server ensured everything was going well.  

Food:

Lobster Risotto - This was very creamy and cheesy. I took one bite and I knew right away that this is something I would order again if I return in the future. Highly recommend this if you eat here.

Gnocchi - The gnocchi is handmade and it was delicious. The texture of the gnocchi was amazing. The gnocchi was in a rose sauce and this was very tasty. 

Overall:

I enjoyed the food here very much; I absolutely love the pasta here! The prices are also very good for the food quality. I will definitely return to try more pasta.",2
870,The food was just horrible. The food was bland and the servers told us to try dishes that did not taste well,0
924,"Neighbourhood gem. No joke. For those of you who are looking for fast, damn tasty pasta and pizza this is the place you need to come. It's all about the food. Nothing fancy, but good for friends to meet up, or even if you just need to grab a quick meal. A lot of options on the menu and everything is made fresh and delicious. The servers are friendly. There is also a take-out option. Don't need to twist my arm to return here!",2
281,"Came here the other day with my friend and ordered two tacos. The steak taco ($4) and the baja fish taco ($7.50). The steak taco was good, the meat was cooked nicely and tasted exactly like what I expected. Unfortunately the baja fish taco was a but underwhelming, kinda dry and just average tasting. The baja fish taco wasn't really worth the extra price, despite how big the piece of  fish was. The lime slices were also pretty dry but since it's winter now I can understand how it happened. 

In general the tacos here are just average, give this place a try if you're in the area and trying to quickly satisfy your taco craving.",1
305,"Friendly service and accommodated a baby no problem on busy Sunday evening.

I tried 3 types of tacos and the standout was the fish taco for me. I absolutely loved my margarita with the star anise spice in it. Must try!

I would return to try a burrito, they looked massive.",1

Amazing pizza, thin crust, firm and full of flavour. 
Actually anything I try here is done well.....
Great food and awesome service without the pretentious attitude of other restaurants with similar food.",2
251,"My husband and I went to this cute taqueria last week. I liked the simple ordering process of ordering your food at the counter and then eating in a tucked away back area of the narrow restaurant that was decorated with colourful pennant flags, strings of lights and wooden furniture (some high top tables, others were little booths). I appreciated the cute street food dining type of vibe in there, as well as the friendly staff at the counter and who brought the food to our table.

We ordered the carnita burrito bowl and the grilled fish burrito bowl since we thought it would be more filling than getting just the tacos. When our burrito bowls arrived, each bowl was filled with fresh vegetables, cheese and sour cream to accompany the grilled fish and pork. While the bowls were definitely filling, they were just okay in terms of flavour. I have to admit, it was a bit underwhelming considering the great reviews this place has gotten. Nothing really stood out - I would have loved to taste more of a marinade on the carnitas and the fish was a bit plain. More seasoning or sauces on the protein would have helped the flavours come together more in the burrito bowl. Again, not a horrible meal by any means but not really memorable either... personally, it was a bit of a miss for me on this particular visit but I may come back another time to try some of their other offerings to see if I can upgrade this review.",1
248,"In retrospect, it might have been a mistake to order a burrito from a taco joint.

But I'm a burrito guy; I would easily say it's one of my favorite foods ever, so if I spot it on a menu, I'm almost certainly ordering it.

And so it was that I found myself placing an order for a Carne Asada Burrito with all the fixins (including guacamole, which I paid extra for) on a recent Thursday evening.

After a wait of about 10 minutes, my burrito was ready to eat and I knew I had made a mistake with the very first bite. That first taste contained only plain iceberg lettuce and, worse still, it was almost ice cold. Yikes.

As I continued eating, I did begin to taste the Carne Asada and other ingredients and they are, to put it mildly, nothing special. There are virtually no bold flavors to be had here, and though I had asked for the spiciest level of heat, the burrito was surprisingly, disappointing bland.

The meat itself was chewy and unspectacular, too. The whole thing just tasted of a complete and total lack of effort, ultimately.

I might return to try one of Mi Taco's, uh, tacos, but I can't see myself ever ordering another burrito - especially when the far, far superior Burrito Boyz is just around the corner. (Heck, the nearby Mucho Burrito makes a better product!)",0
987,"I absolutely love this place! I've been a whole 3 times. I've had the tasca twice, definitely a favourite! It's essentially a giant ravioli, filed with brie, mushrooms and spinach. Smothered in a rich rose sauce. It's huge and amazingly delicious. I went today and had the salmon pasta (forgot the name), and as usual simply amazing! The service is also outstanding. I've had Jordan twice, he's very friendly and efficient and definitely makes the experience! I don't usually leave my area for food, but Grazie is always worth the subway trip!",2
1139,"I did not choose this place myself, but a friend had reservations for our group of friends on a Saturday night. Waited about 20 minutes to be seated. It is a pretty cozy place and very packed, but I assumed that meant it was delicious too! I thought the food was much too overpriced for the portions. I chose the angel hair pasta and it just tasted like something you whip up at home for a quick meal. I admit I should have just chosen something else with more flavor, but the prices were stopping me. 
I did really enjoy the calamari salad though. It was flavorful and perfectly grilled. Delicious. 
I have to note that it was super chilly inside to the point where my teeth were chattering at the end of our meal. 
I would like to come back to try a different dish though!",1
1909,"This is the best sushi place I have ever tried in my whole life. The dragon on fire sushi was very tasty and full of ingredients, the wonton soup is the best for hangovers, edamame comes salty, the deep fried cheese wonton was so good me and boyfriend finished the whole portion in less than 5 minutes, the green dragon roll came with fresh avocado and a delicious taste, the shrimp tempura lunch was crispy, and the miso soup was a little bit simple but it has several pieces of tofu inside and It might be just personal taste. All the portions were big, and for the prices the food is amazing. It's definitely a great place if you want to eat great food for a fair price. It's better if you call them to order cause they don't charge for delivery if the bill is more than 25 dollars, and they currently have a 10 % off discount because of their grand opening. Again, completely amazing I assure you it is worth it.",2
1086,"We made a last minute reservation here for four on Saturday. The service the food and the ambiance was on point. I had the 8oz prime rib steak with fries. The steak was delicious and cooked to perfection. The fries were crispy and had a very nice dip to dip them into. One friend had gnocchi, orecchiette pugliese and there was another pasta dish. I would say the portions for the pasta were small. We ended up having to order arancini for the pasta people to be full. They were delicious.",2
1917,"Very tasty and unique flavours. This has become a weekly go-to place. The dry noodle is delicious, so are the dumplings and the noodle soup. Can't really go wrong. The duck is also a hit and reheats well. :)",2
35,"For what this spot is, it's fine. It's a King Street taco spot serving the King West crowd. Meaning, it's a bit overpriced (my dining companion asked me ""Are you SURE you only want 3 tacos...?"" while I was ordering) and a bit gimmicky for my liking. To be fair, I was coming off of having some fabulous tacos a couple of days ago at a little neighbourhood takeout where they mostly serve Latinx locals, AND I'm generally not a fan of anything fusion.

You grab a table and then line up to order and pay cafeteria-style. Then you go to the salsa bar for a very good variety of salsas and pico de gallo. Servers bring the food when it's ready. 

The food itself was fine, though don't order the grilled avocado if you don't eat dairy. It's literally just a grilled avocado. Even a healthy amount of pico de gallo and salsa couldn't save it. I found the tortillas really dry.

Atmosphere is cool and the people watching is pretty great. It was very busy with the after-work crowd. I don't think I'd return if I was craving tacos, but I would definitely hang out on their expanded sidewalk patio for a drink and some chips and guacamole.",1
135,"I came here with my friends the other day when we were looking for a cheap place to get dinner. We randomly found this place on yelp so we decided to give it a try and I'm so glad we did!! The tacos are DELICIOUS, and very cheap!! 

I ordered the pollo asado, carne asada and pescado tacos. Each one was made very well, but my favourite was definitely the pescado. 

The tacos were a bit small so keep that in mind if you're really hungry. But overall this is probably one of my new favourite spots and I will be returning!",2
131,"I LOVE THIS PLACEEEE. The tacos are amazing. My favourite is the the haddock fish taco (Pesacado). I just wish the tacos were bigger for $3.75. But I'm for sure coming back. I went in 2 days in a row. And I will definitely go back again next week. I love the lime/lemon soda and apple soda. 

The atmosphere is great. Good amount of seating space. Unfortunately, paid parking at downtown Toronto (intersection: Bathurst and Dundas). 

The staffs are nice and welcoming. Pretty fast and efficient service.",2
466,"Guacamole was good but portions are not that big. The price of dishes are fine. Atmosphere was very nice. For the desert we had churros with chocolate and caramel sauce and they had really good taste and texture. We did waited some extra time for service and we shouldn't, because at that time restaurant wasn't to busy.. No free parking.",1
1759,"Worst experience I have ever had at a restaurant! 
The service was so slow; we got our food after exactly one hour. Also, the server didn't speak English, was aggressive, and had an attitude. 
Moreover, the food was served colder than usual and was extra oily. 
We tried to address the issue to the manager but he said: ""it's okay"". 
I don't recommend even giving this restaurant a try!",0
1552,"This place is magic. So cheap, and so tasty. Sorry Mother's, but this place just ate your lunch.

One really cool thing seemed to happen when I was there - someone came in to pick up an order, and brought her own reusable containers. There was some back and forth, I think about how they had been cleaned, but sure enough, they went back to the kitchen and out came her order packed to go.

It's more of a fast food type setup than Mother's, but there's a bit of seating, and you can sit and eat no problem. The menu's just on display screens, from what I could tell, but it had a good number of options. 

And the prices are outstanding value.",2
942,"Mamma's meatballs are one of the many reasons to hit this location. Owner  is a reason to visit Danforth location, always entertaining if you sit at the bar :)
The food is always on point at the Eglinton location. The lasagna, rapini, everything I have had is always great and feels like it is homemade and made specifically for you. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, as well as intimate. 
This is more of a southern Italian feel, crusty rolls to wipe your plate after polishing off the saucy morsels in front of you. 
Always a favourite and will always recommend!",2
500,"Mr.H and I were here for a celebratory dinner, right when you walk in this place has a modern and minimalist ambiance, very different from most other mexican restaurants. Like really... I did not see one decorative skull. Lol

I tried two cocktails, the Primaverde and a special for the day called Breakfast in Mexico. Both were amazing!

For food we tried the below:

Tuna Tostada - yummy... the sesame and spice on this really makes it unique.

Seafood cocktail - Mr.H loved it but this was my least favorite dish. I thought it was too tart to enjoy. 

Lamb Masa - One of my favorite from the night, the lamb was so beautifully cooked, extremely delicious. A must try if you love lamb.

Beets - This was ordered from the greens section of the menu and was surprisingly very tasty. The creamy base and seasoning made it a perfect pairing with the grill pork.

Grill Pork - OMG! Served with roasted pineapple and a caramelized onion sauce it was what you'd call ""melts-in-your-mouth"" deliciousness!!! 

I'd heard their meats are amazing so I'm excited to try this place again and maybe have the beef next time. 

The service was perfect and I've certainly added this place to my list of must trys in Toronto.",2
1308,"The only place I'd go for ice cream in the winter. Thee best ice cream shop in all of GTA! Well worth the line up. The ginger cookie is my fave. So many delicious flavours! London Fog, taro, lychee, mint, chocolate..

Matcha jasmine 
Milk tea: can add tapioca pearls (bubbles/boba) for 50cents",2
1318,"Black Sesame Tan Tan:
Nice chewiness of the noodles, and it was very filling despite looking like a small portion. The fun part about this dish is you grind the black sesame and add it to your bowl as you desire! The black sesame added a very fragrant taste. This was a nice experience, however it was too salty for me (apparently a lot of things I eat are too salty for me though??? Something must be wrong with my taste buds). I tried my friends white sesame noodles and that was less salty, and the broth was more light and creamy. I would probably get that instead next time. Glad to finally be able to cross Ramen Isshin off my list",1
496,"Always service with a smile at this incredibly clean and tidy little restaurant! The customer service is second to none with this authentic Mexican food! The seating area is very small and cozy, and impeccably clean, and the food is DELICIOUS. Tacos, fresh tortilla chips, AMAZING guacamole, so many ingredients made fresh in house, and the spicy sauces are actually spicy! The tortillas are fresh and delicious as well. 

We ordered a huge takeout order for our office, and they made it very quickly! Everything was well organized and it was a hit! I can't recommend this restaurant enough. I will definitely be coming back.",2
1366,"I first found Miku during summerlicious and I must say this is my favourite sushi place in Toronto!! The level of finess and creativity/artistry that goes into Miku's fusion sushi is amazing and honestly better than sushi in Japan. My favourite from Miku is their assorted sushi platter. There are 10 or so carefully crafted rolls with perfect seasoning in each for a burst of flavor in each bite. Their fish are carefully seasoned, and even delicious feel intimidated by raw fish because it doesn't feel fishy... if that makes sense. 

Ever since, I have been back to Miku three times because I just can't get enough! I have tried their calamari, their specialty uni platter, and sashimi. The sashimi is also very high quality, tastes fresh and creamy. 

Another hidden gem is their Momo sake (peach wine). I normally hate the taste of alcoholic drinks but I want to buy 10 bottles of this!! It's very very peachy and so delicious if you like sweet fruits and wines. 

My recommended menu is $38 sushi platter and peach wine if you want to try Miku without killing your wallet!!",2
1399,"Clearly this place is very popular because there was a line out the door during prime time dinner. This disappointing part is the table set up. It's so packed. We couldn't get to our table without telling like two tables if they can move. In addition, we were very confused about the food options. We had to send our noodles back because it's not what we wanted. I asked to double check before that could happen  but I guess there was a miscommunication. Also i was not a fan of the chicken we ate. Tasted mainly like a lot of fat and breading. The second  pair of noodles we got were very delicious.
Overall I'm not the biggest fan of the service and the food. Except the Lo MEIN, those were good
Menu:
General Tao Chicken
Lo Mein Beef and Vegetables",1
703,This place is overhyped.... the food was quite mediocre however the line was out the door the entire time we were there. We tried the Spaghetti & Meatballs and the Chicken Parmesan Sandwich. The meatball was delicious. However the rest was forgettable.,0
1017,"My friend recently moved to the Junction area and we decided to try this place out. Unfortunately, we didn't have a great experience. I was the first to arrive and there were quite a few empty tables on a Friday evening. The hostess said that she'd seat me when the rest of my party arrived (understandable). 5 minutes later, another customer came in (she was an older woman) and said she was waiting on 2 other people. The hostess sat her down immediately, which was a little weird to me but I didn't want to cause a scene and didn't ask about it. When the rest of my party arrived, it took them forever to seat us as it was getting busier and they were slightly understaffed. 

The food itself was good but the portions were small for the appetizers. We ordered the burrata and octopus to share. The burrata salad tasted fresh but for $20 it wasn't worth it in my opinion. Likewise, the octopus was chopped up into tiny pieces and served with potatoes. We each had about 2 tiny bites of octopus. However, the most disappointing part of the meal was the main. All four of us got the duck ragu pappardelle and I was surprised that it came with tomato sauce. The pappardelle itself tasted fresh and they were generous with the duck but too bad they were drenched in tomato sauce. I've had amazing ragu sauce at other places before and this was overwhelmingly disappointing despite it being one of their best seller. I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon.",1
1065,"I have been to La Vecchia twice so far, and every time the food has been amazing. The service is also very great. It is a nice restaurant with a romantic vibe, perfect for a date or just to go with your friends. 
The second time I was there I got the vegetarian pizza (which was really good) and the first time I got a dish with veal and mushrooms. I remember we also got a replica of that dish with lemon instead of mushroom which turned out to be way better. Still the quality of food and service you get here is really good regardless of what you order.
I will definitely go again when I am in the area.",2
47,"Como En Casa is a cheap and cheerful place to get a spicy lunch or supper fix. Recently, I enjoyed a three taco meal with beans and rice. It was filling, tasty and hit the spot. Nothing mind blowing here, but it's delicious no frills Mexican. Bonus points for being on Uber Eats.",2
1806,"When we arrived the restaurant was empty and silent. We were seated at a table that was sticky and bits of food left on the table. We ordered the Chinese burgers, pork soup dumplings and cold noodles. The buns were stale, the noodles were excessively greasy and had a weird texture, and the pork dumpling meat was fatty. After leaving the restaurant, both my girlfriend and I felt very uneasy, she threw up immediately. I originally decided to come to this restaurant based on the reviews but after my experience I would not recommend this to anyone.",0
699,"Giant portion sizes, affordable, a great environment. Came here on a regular weekday night and it was packed. We waited a solid hour before being seated. It is definitely a small establishment. Parking is also your typical Toronto city street parking. I was fortunate enough to find residential parking, most of them are by permit only though, so read the signs! 

Food-wise, I ordered the spaghetti with Bolognese sauce. The pasta was cooked to al dente and bolognese was sparsely embedded with meat. The tomato sauce was tart with a dash of basil and a bit of parmesan (mixed in). It was definitely homemade sauce. It wasn't 100% to my liking as I prefer a more sweet taste. I can tell why others would be so intrigued by this dish however. I am interested in trying their rose sauce pasta at my next visit. So yes, I will be returning! Hopefully with a smaller queue next time, but most likely not.",2
850,"Very nice quaint Italian bistro known for it's authentic food. The owners close in August to return to Italy and refresh their menu. 
The wine list is diverse from a few regions and wide range of prices. Many great selections that are reasonable. 
The food menu has many different choices of pastas and meats. 
We had the mozzarella and tomatoes which unfortunately was pretty dry and tasteless. Salt and balsamic to sage the day!
My wife had a fusilli with chicken and eggplant in a pink sauce that was excellent. I had the spaghetti with shrimp and chicken with a garlic white wine sauce that I smelled the second I walked thru the door. It was amazing!! Spot on in every way. 
We were sitting for a while talking to a regular guest of the place (3-4x/week) and the owner sat down and talked with us, as she does with many of the guests. After a few minutes she said she was going into the kitchen for desert. She brought out a slice of heaven!! A tiramisu that is to die for!! Light, sweet and aromatic of espresso, of course homemade. A superb ending to a wonderful meal. 
This is a gem of a restaurant. Need reservations.",2
900,"Very disappointing! Service is very arrogant service. 
We were asking about the menu and were met with cold and short replies as if we are suppose to know everything about this restaurant ... while it was the first time that we are coming to this restaurant. 

The portions are over fried / too small/ and not tasty at all. Pizza is a joke ... it's not event a pizza it is a dough with ...no .. not cheese ... with something g like cheese...
Anyways - waste of time / money / and mood.",0
1771,It was way over priced for the type of food you get. One particular waiter was very rude (Tony). The other waiters were polite but the ratio of wait staff to patrons was not balanced. We had trouble just getting water or trying to get our bill.,0
1074,"This is definitely Italian food for the after-work crowd, a Buca di Beppo-type of experience that didn't leave that much of an impression on my palate. It wasn't that the food was badly executed but rather that the plates were by-the-numbers unmemorable. I was here with the same dozen people I had been with for the previous eight hours, so small talk opportunities had already been exhausted as we sat closely together at a communal table. Because of the size of our party, I was able to try quite a number of their dishes and got a reasonably broad cross-section.

The common adjective connecting the plates was 'bland'. We started with the $14 Calamari Fritti which apparently came with shishito peppers that had disappeared by the time the plate was passed to me (photo: http://bit.ly/35MxgSg). Meh. I did manage to snag one of the overly chilled prawns on the $21 Shrimp Cocktail platter (photo: http://bit.ly/2EE5UBy). Better were the $13 Beets & Burrata with arugula and toasted almonds (photo: http://bit.ly/34Lnhva) and the $12 Greens which added celery hearts for crunch and a drizzle of sherry vinaigrette (photo: http://bit.ly/36TVmKG). The pasta plates were pretty standard issue given the couple of bites I was able to get of each.

The $21 Linguine di Mare was a typical seafood melange with little imagination (photo: http://bit.ly/2PGtJ22), while the $18 Tortiglioni alla Bolognese at least provided meatiness in the veal & pork ragu, but again it was bland and lacked freshness (photo: http://bit.ly/373WnjJ). The three different pizzas disappointed. The $18 Verdure had toppings and a basil pesto that were rather skimpy on the chewy crust (photo: http://bit.ly/38R3Y6R). while the $17 Margherita was just wet (photo: http://bit.ly/2Q1UXzi). Only the $19 Prosciutto was reasonably good with the padano cheese and prosciutto more plentiful (photo: http://bit.ly/34GULe2). 

Dessert came on cutting boards, and they offered a trio of which truthfully I only tried the Tiramisu Cake Roll which was OK (photo: http://bit.ly/2M8ukaH). There was also Chocolate Budino and Cannolo though my colleagues grabbed those pretty quickly (photo: http://bit.ly/36UM69j). My favorite part of the meal? The $14 Pimms Cup with ginger ale, lemon & cucumber, which honestly hit the spot far more than any of the food (photo: http://bit.ly/2SarzJH). Listen, none of us had high hopes for culinary delights here, and even our sponsor admitted this was not her first choice, but the proximity to our hotel just made it so convenient.

FOOD - 2.5 stars...standard issue Italian with few surprises
AMBIANCE - 2 stars...loud and rather packed after work

951,"Homemade italian fare oozing with passion and love.  

If its in the revolving menu that evening, do get the veal sausage.  Its wonderful, juicy, and very tasty.  

Make sure to try the veal meatballs, the eggplant parmigiana, and the almighty Lasagna!

Basically, you cannot go wrong.  And ask for the hot peppers on the side.  I wish they sold these!!!

Ambiance is casual/romantic.  Very good food without the pretension.   10000 stars if I could.",2
851,"I have one question: who are you people who gave this a 4 or 5 star rating??????
We visited for dinner on Saturday evening. When the server appeared to fill our water glasses using a plastic pitcher we knew it was a bad sign. Most disappointing dining experience. We made the reservation based on reviews. I'm simply shocked this restaurant has a 4.5 rating. The food attempts to be high end fine cuisine but is really just pretending. We had the caprese salad. The tomatoes were large (rock) hard basic garden tomatoes - served freezing cold. The mozzarella was rubbery, not creamy like a caprese salad should be. The arugula was a basic run-of-the-mill salad. Excessive and boring. I had the black cod special. The portion was huge and that was all it had going for it. The cod was served on a big bowl full of under cooked garden vegetables (carrots and cauliflower) with watery-tomato sauce. It was a dish you'd expect at a family restaurant chain. It wasn't served how black cod should be. My husband's excessive serving of orecchette was bland and served in a bowl of liquid. 

The only positive feedback we can share...the martinis were delicious and the server was lovely and friendly. 

It was a cold evening but the dining room was uncomfortably cold and the washrooms were FREEZING.  Yes, it was a very cold evening in the city but this is a restaurant - it should at least be warm. I understand the restaurant has been around for over 30 years - they've had plenty of time to figure out the heating. 

The dining room is old and tired, not in a charming way. There was paint peeling from the ceiling above us. We were seated at a table beside a shelf loaded with about 100 bottles of wine that hadn't been dusted in the restaurant's 30years. I've not seen a worse display of wine.

I loved that it was a family-owned restaurant - that's whey we went. It's low end and overpriced. This is not a Yorkville-grade restaurant. Save your money.",0
796,"Not feeling it for the new fancy location.

Love the old location with old friendly staff than the new ones.  The price is more expensive, and the food is not as good.  The new staff didn't know about serving / dinner etiquette.  Serving both left and right side.  With the lower food quality and higher price tag / seemed more fancy environment will look for more.  The owner is still there and he has to work hard and busy himself by telling the new younger staff what needs to be done.

Really disappointing that the food was not as good as before (far from it).",1
1039,"Great little spot tucked away in Liberty village. The pizza was really good for a thicker crust pizza. Although it was thick, the dough was very fluffy and light, but crispy on the outside. Their Funghi pizza was a very solid mushroom pizza,and their pasta seems to be freshly made in house. Their staff were really friendly, and good folks. We witnessed the staff celebrating a fellow coworker's birthday with a candle in pizza.. What hard working staff, working hard on a Saturday night late shift. I highly recommend this place if you're in the area and craving some good well priced Italian food.",2
29,"Came here early for dinner on a weekend so there weren't too many people. But when we started to leave there was a line to order and not enough seats.

You order in front, get seated and they will bring you your order. The service was quick and friendly. 

We ordered the elotes and every taco on the menu. 
Favourites:
- elotes - creamy, sweet and savoury but kind of pricey for one corn 
- the unoriginal 
- carne asade
- baja fish 
- All the meats have great flavour, and not dry. Fish was nicely fried to a light crunch.

I love the salsa bar! So many options! I especially love the pineapple salsa, gave a nice sweet punch to some tacos. 

The seating area is not that large but it is fast-paced whereas people leave after they finish. 

Tacos are ok size, probably would have to order 3 to be full. I would say the price is not as bad as other places. I'd love to come back and try their other items!",2
671,"Foods were good and we had a good time dining as a group. Unfortunately, nearing the end of our meal, we got yelled at by the chef for being late for our reservation. 
We apologize but he kept on going which makes it awkward for us and leaves a sour taste on otherwise a nice evening out with friends and good meal.",1
58,"Two words can summarize my thoughts on the food here: overpriced and bland. I was super stoked to try Como En Casa because (1) I LOVE Mexican food and (2) fellow Yelpers have given this place such glowing reviews. We placed a takeout order on a Friday night. I ordered a small chicken burrito and my husband ordered a large verde burrito with beef. When I called and placed the order on the phone, the person asked me ""if guacamole was okay"". I said yes. To my chagrin, the guacamole was an extra charge, and we ended up paying nearly $30 for two burritos. I recognize that it's partly my fault for not checking if guacamole was extra, but I thought the way that I was asked suggested it was included, and they were asking if I wanted it on my burrito. Just seemed kind of slimy, if you ask me. 

All of this (including the high-ish price tag) would have been fine if I enjoyed my burrito. Negative. The meat was incredibly dry and bland. I barely had any chicken in my burrito, and if I did manage to snag some meat, it tasted like chewy old chicken. The burrito was mostly rice with, like, one piece of lettuce. I barely tasted a tomato or anything to break up the rice. I didn't notice any beans or sour cream. Honestly, this was a terrible burrito. I think I'm pretty easy to impress with Mexican food, but this was just horrible. My husband didn't like his either. I won't be wasting my precious Friday-night cheat meal on this place.",0
596,"Coming here for the 3rd time because I was craving pizza. We got a seat right away around 7pm on Friday on the lower floor. Nice candlelit tables, dim, however very loud and we had to shout across the table to hear each other.

Went with the basic margarita pizza and fries. Despite my food coming fast, my pizza was cold :( Probably waited on the counter too long because my bf's pizza was warm. Thin and crunchy, I had a salt craving that day lol.

The fries tasted like layz fries (oily and crunchy) but airier. Comes with light garlic sauce.

Decided to try a panna cotta for dessert (blood orange for 10.99) I'm sad to say this is one of the worst desserts i've tasted, just wasn't my cup of tea. I thought it would be a custard consistency considering it's heavy cream based, but it came in a cup instead. And it wasn't creamy nor sweet- it was really sour! The orange froth on top was okay but then you get to orange chunks in the middle that's really tangy, and at the bottom you have olive oil?? My taste buds did not like the combination of olive oil and orange. Sorry, but i couldn't finished it :/",1
1355,"I've tried Miku for the first time in Vancouver for my birthday last year and I loved it! So when winterlicious 2020 came out, it was the perfect time to try their Toronto location. They were fully booked for their dining tables so we had to walk in and sit at the bar/high top tables. We chose to sit at their open kitchen and we quite enjoyed the view of the chefs preparing everyone's food! 

For their winterlicious menu, we had the lunch tasting with an option for appetizer, main and dessert. I chose the sashimi selection with 6 pieces and feature kobachi. My boyfriend chose the Miku Zen - tuna crudo, panko fried scallops, truffle tamari Shoyu chicken, tofu salad. We both just shared our appetizers so we could taste more of their dishes. The sashimi tasted fresh and wonderful and their Miku Zen dishes was a good tasting experience. The ingredients they used blended well all together for each dish and I thoroughly enjoyed it. 

For both our mains we had the Signature Aburi Sushi Plate - Salmon Oshi, Saba Oshi, Coal Harbor roll, Bincho Nigiri, Ebi Nigiri. My favourite piece out of the 5 given was the Ebi Nigiri...my gosh it was the best Ebi nigiri I've ever tasted! It was definitely very different from your usual shrimp nigiris that you would order at regular sushi AYCE restaurants. It melted like butter and the texture was very pleasant. I would for sure reorder it again when I come back to Miku in the future. 

Lastly, for dessert we both ordered their Green Tea Opera dessert. The matcha ice cream was a nice pairing with the cake and I also loved the hazelnut wafer piece to finish it off! The server also recommended tea with the dessert to tie in all the flavours.

As for the service here, it's wonderful! Our server was great and they even have free coat check if there's no room to place your coat. After each course came out, the server also explained the dish and all the ingredients on the plate. 

A great first winterlicious lunch experience at $33 + tax! Hoping they offer a summerlicious tasting menu, but regardless, I would love to come here again in the future.",2
1296,"Sort of an overhyped ice cream shop.

They indeed offer unique flavours, but it's significantly more expensive than necessary. Their flavours are fun to try if you haven't been here, but I would probably never return with their exuberant prices. Two tiny scoops of ice cream can run you nearly $10. You can find plenty of ice cream shops with unique flavours for way less.
Their ice cream is also super melty as well. As soon as I got it, it was already melting all over the place. If you're into soft serve, this is your spot--but I'm a hard serve ice cream kind of person.",1
1878,"First of all, let's be clear. Growing up in Asia, I have tasted the best of the best! So I'm not easily impressed by Chinese restaurants overseas. Lai Wah Heen came with rave reviews by Canadians, so I thought I'd check it out and see how it measured up to restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong.

Verdict - Lai Wah Heen, which is supposedly 5-star here in Toronto, has dim sum that any 3-star restaurants in Singapore (eg. Mid-tier Wah Lok would win hands down) and Hong Kong can easily beat.

The presentation was nice. The taste profile of some of their offerings were decent, but there was only ONE stand-out dish that wowed - and that was the lava custard buns, which were flawlessly executed.

My biggest complaint was the skin on the steamed dumplings. The skin was too thick (especially the lobster dumpling) and chewing through it was laborious.

Overall, it's not worth the price.",0
1463,"I've never had authentic Chinese food before, so not sure what to compare it to. But the food I had here was simple and flavorful. I had the Shanghai noodles, bok choy with garlic and veggie dumplings. This was a lot of food for two people but we finished it. Everything tasted very fresh and light. Service was a little slow even though the restaurant was empty.",2
1681,"As an avid fan of Dagu, I must say that Fudao is a veryyy close second (I'll explain why later). Their prices are on average $2 ish cheaper than Dagu and the concept is similar with a few differences in the toppings. I got their picked cabbage soup and man was it good. The soup came out bowling hot and it was hard to not want to drink it in a rush because the flavor was ON POINT. The reason why rated this second to Dagu is because the rice noodles are thinner and I prefer thicker noodles. All in all, 5/5 for value and variety.",2
551,"First things first: Great service! They were so polite, friendly and for the most part fast 

The margaritas were fantastic! I will definitely be back for those! However, the food left my taste buds in complete disappointment!! The appetizer was alright- everything was bland for myself and my boyfriend. 

Entrees: my boyfriend ordered the beef enchiladas. They looked fantastic and I would know, I was looking at his meal for awhile.. I was kept waiting for my chicken enchiladas for about an additional 5-10 minutes after he got his. When it finally came, my rice was cold! Not to mention? I found a hair in it. I pretty much lost my appetite right there. But I was just too hungry in the end- so I ate around my nasty rice. Again, food was bland! For Mexican food, I expect bold flavours and spices... I got none of this. Not to mention, the ""spicy"" sauce was not even a hint of spice in there. 

I gave them three stars because they were über nice and the service was good. However, this is a Mexican place I won't be visiting again for the food.",1
1845,"This place is pretty much the epitome of ""hole in the wall."" Tucked into a little strip mall, the restaurant is unassuming from the outside and tiny on the inside. There are no dine-in options - it's take-out only.

When you walk inside, you'll be able to see all the roast meats hanging and spinning. If the doors to the back room are open, you can even see the chefs chopping up the raw meat just two meters away. At the counter, you can see some of the side dishes on display, to help you decide what to order.

The menu has a variety of options, including duck, pork, and chicken, as well as sides such as vegetables and rice. I ended up getting the roast duck with steamed bok choy on the side. The roast duck was delicious - though quite messy to eat, due to all of the juices and bones. The steamed bok choy was lackluster.

The food was tasty and the tiny half restaurant / half butcher shop was quite an experience. It's worth a stop if you're craving some meat and aren't afraid of the grittier environment.",1
254,"If I ever need a quick fix for Taco's I would probably go back. The tacos were small, small amounts of filling but overall the taste was not bad. You get 3 small Tacos for $10 something. I wish they were a bit bigger and there was more topping options. 

Keep Eating,

915,"Everything was amazing. Bruschetta, fried calamari, garlic bread, entrees...everything was delicious and came to our table quickly. Great mojito also",2
875,"The food was good. But nothing amazing. We ordered the branzino it was good showed us the fished carved it table side. Great presentation.  Unfortunately it tasted like it was drowned in oil and lacked other flavours. We also ordered cured fish. Most of them tasted good some of them just tasted fishy.

The service wasn't bad. Over it was good had to try pretty hard to get our server a few times.  

Also they have a fruit fly problem inside.  Nov 2019. Half way through our meal we went from having one fly to 10. It wasn't pleasant.  The server were kind enough to move us to a different table and comp us 2 glasses of wine. But still wasn't what I would expect in this type of establishment.",1

767,"Stelvio is an Italian restaurant in Downtown Toronto. It was packed on a Saturday night and we were lucky to have a table. After glancing the menu, we placed our order. Shortly after, our server brought us a plate of Poppyseed Sesame Bread served with EVOO balsamic vinegar dipping sauce and herb marinated olives.

Based on other Yelp review, we ordered the Taroz, which consisted of crushed potatoes with green beans, butter, onion and cheese served on a iron skillet. It was to die for. The only other thing to die for was Zuppa D'Orzo Carciofi E Patate, which was a soup with barley, artichoke, potatoes, and garlic.

We're weren't too impressed with the Dante Salad, Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini, and Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini. The Dante Salad consisted of shredded pan seared chicken breast, Caesar DOP cheese, lettuce, and red chicory lightly tossed in a dijon vinaigrette. I didn't like how either Tagialette had much flavor or sauce. Tagialette Al Funghi Porcini consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with porcini mushrooms. Tagialette Al Ragu Bianco consisted of fresh homemade tagliatelle pasta with homemade meat sauce and fried herbs including sage and rosemary.",1
522,"Food (3/5): decent. The corn chips were nice and crispy but the toppings were lacklustre in taste. There also wasn't enough sauce and cheese to cover the chips 

Price (2.5/5): a bit over priced for what you get 

Ambiance (3.5/5): quaint and cute decor, in a good location. No seating though!

Service (4/5): got this to go through ritual, the food was made fresh and there was only a very brief wait!",1

1728,"Living in Markham & Scarborough before and now close to Chinatown, I had tasted the best and cheap noodle soup. So trying Noodle King for the first time, I wasn't really impressed.

Yes, their Shrimp Wontons are massively huge and I counted 5 pcs in my soup. So I guess that makes a difference considering they give you crappy servings when you eat in food court places.

But I still paid $8.19 for my soup which to me is still not that cheap. Still the soup didn't blow my mind or something.",1
421,"I came her few weeks ago. I straight up saw this lady (pretty sure the owner) handle cash/ scratch her head and touched the food right after. I

Of course I only had a few bites and left the rest cause I was so grossed out. When I was paying for my bill, I let her know what I saw and she started giving racist quotes. ""All the chinese places do the same thing"", and walked away.

I would have just left it and not think twice, but for them to say something like that, that is a big nono. 

McDonalds food is higher quality than this. 

DO NOT COME HERE.",0
217,"Hole in the wall with limited seating and it was a bit of hard to find to the location because of construction happening in the area. However that made this adventure even better.

I went to high school in this area and it has the reputation for excellent Caribbean and Portuguese delights but this Mexican joint is amazing. Well done and friendly service. The 3 for $10 is an amazing offer. It is at the NE corner of keele and eglinton by the dollar store.

The fish was amazing. I am definitely going back!

Thanks",2
1264,"Not authentic!! It's a good sandwich with good fillings. The bread however, is what makes a Banh mi a Banh mi and it was too soggy. Really good Banh mi bread is just perfect crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. This is not it. The fries were okay as well. Also too soggy. Sigh.",1
753,"Went on a Saturday afternoon and was one of two pairs there which made me sort of second guess but that went away after I tried the gnocchi. Doesn't matter if it's a packed house or you're the only guests if the food holds up. And the food more than holds up. My brunch buddy got the tagliatelle with mushrooms and raved the entire time. Wish there was better bread with something to dip (oils, etc) but that's my only complaint. Portions don't look big but they are quite filling. It ain't cheap though. Well worth it though.",2
200,"After hearing so much good things about this taco spot in the Annex Food Hall, I couldn't wait to try their take-home TACO KITS!!

How to order: 
-online through the tacokittoronto.com website for pick-up or delivery 
-Tuesday DELIVERY IS FREE if you pre-order by the previous Sunday

The Taco kits:
Each kit is only $20-$25 & easily feeds 1-2 people! I tried their Yucatan chicken & Barbacoa Beef. Each came with their own super fresh chopped up toppings and baggie of corn tortillas. I reheated the meat by microwaving in time intervals and the tortillas were warmed on a stovetop pan with a bit of oil.

YUCATAN CHICKEN (4.5/5) - saucey and the complex spices that marinated the juicy chicken was perfection. Paired with pickled radish & cheese made the flavours pop even more.

BARBACOA BEEF (5/5) - THE JUICIEST shreds of flavourful beef. I absolutely loved the freshness that a sprinkle of onions, cilantro & lime did to it. And I can't forget about that creamy avocado spread! 

Overall:
I'm honestly so surprised at how generous they were with their ingredients and the amazingly JUICY & FLAVOUR-PACKED meats. These taco kits are easy, fresh, and a fun way to do take-out. Definitely recommend giving El Nahual a try for your next Taco Tuesday!",2
1882,"Regardless if you're Chinese food purist or a new age Asian fusion maven, you'll probably find something here that you'll like. 

Keep in mind you are dining in the double tree, so you will be paying for everything from the food to the service. 

I made a reservation for Christmas Eve dinner and it was quite busy. The star dishes here are really the Peking duck or lobster if you're having a big dinner party. The lobster can be cooked in two different styles, so I would opt for one fried and one steamed so you get some variety. The pork belly here is incredibly tender and the best I've had so far. I would stay away from the dim sum platter, as it leaves much to the imagination. However, their specialty dim sum seem to be a hit, so that may be something I'll have to come back and try. 

If you are parking in the hotel underground lot, the restaurant will cover part of the cost!",2
527,"4 stars for their crispy beef tacos, 2 stars for their very greasy veggie tacos. I prefer their crispy tacos to those at the Haam.

Honestly, their crispy tacos are pretty solid, but they need serve it yourself salsa to really bring them together and put them over the top. I'll probably bump this to 4 stars once they do let customers add their own salsa.

Otherwise, you'll still likely get better tacos than you're expecting from this tiny shack across from the Eaton Centre.",1
734,"It's become increasingly clear that ambiance plays almost as big a role in my enjoyment of a meal as the food itself, and this concept was certainly illustrated in spades during my time at Enoteca Sociale.

We arrived around 6:00 on a weekday, and though we didn't have a reservation, we were immediately shown to a table on the patio.

It's a nice patio, admittedly, but there are definitely some problems. The biggest and most obvious issue is the lack of space between the tables. We were sitting between two other tables and there was probably only a few inches separating us and our neighbors. It was less than private, to put it mildly.

We were also sitting underneath some trees and there was some sap or something that kept falling. The diners to our left actually wound up moving because of it, and my dining companion wound up with some gross-looking stuff on her shirt.

It's not exactly an atmosphere conducive to enjoying a quiet, romantic meal, is my point.

Anyway, in terms of the food, Enoteca Sociale is definitely an above-average destination. We were presented with some complimentary bread to snack on, and it was delicious. The bread was fresh and tasty, while the accompanying oil contained a smokiness that I found irresistible.

For my main, I went with the Amatriciana (""Guanciale, tomato, Pecorino Romano & chili""), and aside from the fact that it's an almost comically small portion (I think I ate the whole thing in about two minutes), this is definitely a top-notch bowl of pasta. The tomato sauce contains exactly the sort of deep richness that one covets, while the pasta itself was cooked quite well. The concoction could've been hotter (i.e. it was probably sitting for a few minutes before I got it), but otherwise I really dug the heck out of this.

It's just too bad about that ambiance.",1
642,"Good food, but the pasta and pizza was a little saltier then expected (But still good)!  Sevice was okay as well",2
245,"Hidden away on Queen West is this blink and you'll miss it taco joint. The interior is roughly the size of a shoebox, decorated festively, with a fake slanted roof. The roof makes it feel unnecessarily cramped. 

This place was rather disappointing. I brought my friends here because I enjoyed it a lot the first time around, but this visit was nowhere as good. The service here was wonderfully efficient, but the food was disappointing. I ordered the 3 taco plate (2 carnitas, 1 chicken tinga), chips and salsa verde, and a margarita. My total bill was around $22, which was not bad. The margarita was the best part of my order. 

Unlike other places, the margarita was strong. I got a good buzz from just one glass of margarita. It wasn't too sweet or tart or artificial-tasting, but rather perfectly balanced. The same cannot be said for the similarly green salsa verde. With saltier chips, the salsa might have tasted better, but with the very plain tortilla chips, the salsa tasted underseasoned and very vinegary - badly in need of salt. 

The tacos were similar in taste - while the freshness of the ingredients inside can be tasted, there wasn't enough of it, and it was hard to tell the difference between the chicken and the pork. A bit more seasoning could have helped. Lastly, the corn tortillas were absolutely dreadful. I had several mouthfuls of dry tortilla without filling to give it flavor and much-needed moisture, and it was like eating paper. I think the tortillas were kept under heat lamps for just a bit too long.

In summary, I'd come for the margaritas, but would not consider it this the best tacos in town.",1
1704,"Fresh ramen noodles are not the healthiest food you can eat, but do taste so good.  I picked a dish with braised beef.  The noodles were extremely enjoyable. The braised beef was not tender.  Next time I will pick another meat with extra noodles!

311,"When did Gerrard and Jones become a popular destination? Good on it. 

Quick summary:

- nice rooftop patio
- I had slowish service
- Food was good. We had a churizo bowl and the ceviche. Both were solid. I didn't notice anything special about the menu. Standard upper-middle level Mexican foods. 
- Drinks ok (cider + tequila based fruity blend).
- overpriced. Why is Mexican food so expensive in Toronto? It's mostly bloody rice, tomatoes, lettuce, avo, standard meats.
- The staff was decent not great but it was busy hence the pressure of Friday night at play. 
- Personally I wouldn't go back at that pricing but if you don't mind that you may like the food. 

2/5 maybe 2.5. 

Tears for Mcguiggan's.",0
330,"One of the better mexican restaurants on the east side! Ordered the tacos al pastor, they were very good and cheap!! the burrito wasn't the best and definitely must try the nachos and churros! The add on for the guac was definitely worth it!  
Also the drinks were good and decently priced!",2
1646,"Summary: clean, classy, classic vibe restaurant serves tasty Chinese food!


It was pretty quiet on a Thursday at 12:30 pm. I was content seeing the minimalist look and classic blue white dishware - it honestly reminded me of my childhood.

The lady at the counter recommended the General Tao chicken but I was on a budget and the chicken didn't come with rice (rice is $2 a bowl)... Plus I had my heart set on getting the green onion pancake as an appetizer, so I went with that plus the braised beef noodles.

The green onion pancakes came first and were quite good. They split into an outer and inner rim. The outer rim has plentiful green onions... Tasty!

The braised beef noodles came after - medium mild width was perfect for me (I'm very particular about the size of my noodles), there was a solid amount of meat and it was mostly tender, and the noodles were perfectly al dente! In addition to chunks of meat there is also a bit of shredded pieces of the beef as you dive into the meal... Delicious!

The meal comes with a white rabbit candy after.

Solid experience!",2
774,"The only reason I visited was because I had a gift card due to poor service from my previous visit. I'd say they redeemed themselves in terms of service for this visit. Our server was extremely friendly, helpful, and attentive. We were also seated in an area downstairs from the main dining area which made it feel more intimate and allowed the sever to check up on us more often. I came for Valentine's Day dinner and was still able to get a table for a group of 6 a week in advance. 

I ordered the gnocchi and it was alright. The pasta itself was cooked perfectly but the sauce was kind of basic. I've had better gnocchi elsewhere but for the price point here, I was expecting a bit more. I think some pasta may be more worth it than others on their menu. The homemade gelato was the highlight of my meal - super creamy and soft, great flavour, good portion. I had the hazelnut and pistachio and it was some of the best gelato I've ever had. 

Overall, I think you could find better or just as good food elsewhere, at the same price point. But worth a try if your an Italian food lover, even if just for the gelato.",1
645,"Definitely an experience of a lifetime. This is a good date night restaurant. The vibes, the food, just perfect. One thing to note is that the restaurant's entrance isn't on the main street so you have to walk through a cute alley to get there. Also, it's super busy on the weekends, so I recommend making reservations ahead of time. Their food was amazing, from the starters to the mains. I will definitely recommend this place to anyone who's looking for good Italian food.",2
1,"Went here with my friends and family. I liked the spice side fillings and their lobster tacos was good I heard. I had the veggie enchiladas and was alright. Even the veggie tostadas was good. However, I feel the food was expensive for the food quality.

Guacamole and chips - good needed some spice 
Chicken wings - so so

1895,"NEVER ORDER FROM THIS RESTAURANT! We order from them at least 10 times a week, from our staff to our agents. And today they showed us how POOR their customer service is. We got food poisoning from their food and one of their employees called us disrespectful names. When we walked over to talk to the manager, one of their employees lied and said he was the manager AND the owner - told us he doesn't believe us and that we don't ever have to order from them again because our money doesn't keep their business open. THE WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE EVER! Save your money and order from a place you would feel valued as a loyal customer instead!",0
879,"Debated long and hard on what rating to give; ultimately decided on a 3.5, but rounded downwards to a 3! Although I had a great time there with  colleagues, it was really due to the company. The food was decent (neither spectacular nor amazing), but the service was, for the most part, non-existent. It took so long to flag someone down!

We had reserved a table for 10 at 6:30PM, and were seated in a private area, slightly hidden from the rest of the restaurant. To start, we ordered a selection of three salumi di mare. Don't be fooled! While many things here at Buca Yorkville are seafood-related, the salumi does contain some pork options. With the server's recommendation, we got the Soppressata di Polipo (octopus salami which therefore includes pork), Opah (cured moonfish), and I believe the Salmone Affumicato (smoked salmon). Accompanying this spread were gnocco fritto, fried squid ink dumplngs made with pork fat, and two small pieces of pickled onion. The smoked fish was the best and absolutely stole the show! It had a very rich and smoky flavour, and the saltiness whet my appetite. However, the other salumi were just okay.

A must order at Buca is the nodini - these small garlicky bread knots that are little bites of heaven! As my manager says, these are the ""yesdini"". We got two orders for the table, but as the knots disappeared in record time, we ordered another two portions. These nodini really stole the show!

We then ordered our own mains; I got the Polipo e Vongole. A small whole octopus came placed on top of some clams and crispy artichokes, with these al dente small pasta balls (the fregola sarda, which resembles couscous) soaking up the delicious broth. However, the octopus truly fell flat. It was soft, but lacked all flavour - it was bland, unseasoned, and just didn't stand out. For a main that costs $50, I was expecting something a bit more. My colleague ordered the risotto, and was very disappointed as well. It came in an extremely small and shallow bowl / plate, and he devoured it all in the matter of minutes. 

For dessert, we ordered two pairs of three desserts (from the four on the menu) to share:
Tiramisu - This dish barely resembled a tiramisu, and was more along the lines of a deconstructed dessert with a dark chocolate shell and mascarpone cream. It was interesting, but not what we were craving for and wanted.
Pizelle - This dessert stole the show, and was the best! The peach preserve and whipped cream made it appear deceivingly light (although you're well aware it's not, given all the dairy and richness). The presentation was also lovely; when the server poured the ganache over the top, the dessert was just imploring me to take photos!
Torta - I forgot the full name, but this chocolate hazelnut tart served with olive oil and squid ink just completely missed the mark. The olive oil imparted some savouriness to the dish, but the squid ink took it to a whole other level by adding some fishy essence. We left this largely untouched.

The wine assortment here is good, but also pricey (we paid ~$250 for a bottle of red, I believe). If I were to go to Buca again, I'd likely go to the King location for more of the earthy and meaty pasta choices. While this location was decent, it simply didn't meet expectations.",1
1752,"The service was friendly, the place was definitely clean, and the food was good and affordable. I wasn't there long and didn't try many dishes, so I can't say too much, but I can at least say that I would return if I were in the area again.",2
1050,"I really wanted to like this place. I've had it bookmarked for ages as I love Italian food but I don't go downtown often so I saved it for a day when I was in the area. 
Anyways that day finally came and I went for my favourite Margarita pizza. But the excitement fizzled as soon as I saw my food. It looked sad. The crust looked crispy but when I bite into it, it was doughy and almost underdone. There was very little ingredients on the pizza and dough to ingredient ration was seriously off. I'm thinking I probably just went at the wrong time on the wrong day but still.... I've literally been waiting over a year to try this place with rad reviews. Honestly disappointed. I didn't even finish it.",0
754,"meeeeeeh.... I really wasn't all that impressed with this place. 

The decor and service were really good for sure. But the food was just OK. Considering how many amazing Italian restaurants there are in Toronto, I would not come back to this one. 

One thing that really surprised me was that the food was cold and didn't taste fresh. It sort of tasted like it had been reheated. 

The appetizers were fine but not amazing. The risotto, osso buco, and pasta did not live up to the hype -- just imo.",1
1575,"I recently checked out Hotopia with my friend because we wanted to try their sichuan pickled flavour fish soup.  You can choose different kinds of fish like basa fish.  We ended up with Tilapia.  The pot that came was big enough for 2 to 3 people.  My friend and I didn't manage to finish the pot.  The soup was actually pretty good.  It was more sour than spicy, but I liked the mix of flavours.  The Tilapia unfortunately was overly filled with bones.  I was surprised by this.  The staff didn't caution us about the bones, so we ended up spending the evening spitting them out, which was not my idea of an enjoyable meal.  
Maybe there is an alternative without bones.  I would like to go back and check out other dishes on the menu.  It's a fairly new restaurant, and was pretty packed when we were there.  But service was prompt.",0
309,"I came here with a friend and ordered the beef and the fish tacos. The food was pretty good, but the restaurant was quite busy so the food took a long time to arrive. The restaurant was also nicely decorated and the rooftop area was very nice.

620,"This restaurant has been on my list since hearing it in a Drake song and didn't disappoint. 

We ordered the grilled calamari, scallops, carbonara, gnocchi, and the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake for dessert. The scallops were a bit salty but overall, everything was delicious!

1618,"Handmade and made to order!! Can't get any fresher than this! 

This was and is now officially be the best dumpling ever. Just might be better than din tai fung! 

These were handmade to order! Have you ever had handrolled to order? Run by a mom and pop and their son. Located below a tall china town building and next to a sketchy massage parlor and popular hot pot place. That's where I found the best dumplings ever. 

Slower than most: everything comes out at different times. Cause they are fresh!! They have noodles and dumplings. Huge menu of dumplings: steamed, boiled, fried, pancake form. They got it all!!


Soup dumplings: the best ones I've tasted!! The best! Poke a hole, let the steam out and bang! Flavortown!! Super tasty!

The potstickers with shrimp and pork were delish. Loved the spicy cucumbers too. And their pan fried buns were so fluffy, it falls apart in your mouth! I got it with shrimp and egg!

Everything was so fresh, you leave happy! And not getting that sick after dumplings feeling: cause it's fresh! 

Cash only, never frozen! And pretty much the best thing ever!!!! Totally coming back!",2
1509,"This is my first and last time trying this place, here is why:
1. Service: I get it, lots of people come here for food, lineup is long, and not that many waiters, but when I was trying to order food, the server was literally so impatient that he kept tapping his fingers on the table loudly, I spent like 2 minutes thinking and he made me feel like I was wasting his time. This is a big NONO for me.
2. The rice noodle roll around fried dough炸两肠粉: for all the people on yelp who recommended it, I really think u should try more places for this before recommendation. I have never seen people put it in soy sauce, ITS SUPPOSED TO BE CRISPY and u put it in liquid, what is the common sense here? And the bottom layer of it was so soggy I didn't even know what I was eatin, mush or food. Then I took a bite of the top layer rolls which did not touch any of the sauce, the fried dough was so soggy and soft and then I suddenly understood why they had to put sauce on it ---- to cover the fact that they don't even know how to make this dish. DO NOT ORDER.
3. Two meat combo rice - roasted pork and roasted duck. When we asked them about the roasted pork, waiter said ""it's crispy"", it WAS 100% NOT CRISPY. I don't understand how do they expect people to pay for dishes with this low quality, I really don't get it.

I can find at least 3 restaurants which costs much less in Chinatown and still beats this place in every aspects, so if I were u, I would avoid it for life.",0
743,"I've heard tons about Enoteca Sociale on my journey to find some of the best Italian food in the city, and it definitely didn't disappoint.

The menu offers several items that you most likely won't find across other Italian restaurants in the city, so it provides a unique experience to say the least.

Our table tried 2 dishes, the Beef Crudo appetizer, and the Cacio e Pepe Paste. The Beef Crudo was a surprise for our table. Neither of us really eat raw meat - but we went out on a limb to try something new and it didn't disappoint! The beef had a great peppery and citrusy flavour, without being gamey at all - which was fear for us! It was a great appetizer to start and to snack on over discussion.

We then had the Cacio e Pepe that's been raved all over Yelp, however I feel like it left me wanting more. I know that the dish is supposed to be simple and made of limited ingredients, but I felt like I was looking for something a extra to push the flavour profile over the edge.

The service was impeccable as we sat at the bar, our server was always very attentive and helpful. Would come back again to try the other options on the menu!",2

1363,"I wanted sooo badly to love Miku ...Because of the high ratings and I being a major sushi lover, I had very high expectations for this place. My overall experience was extremely underwhelming and disappointing.. The quality of the food is definitely not worth the price.

We ordered the anniversary prix fixe, signature sushi selection platter, beef carpaccio and tuna tartare. The prix fixe was OK.. quantity wise this one is actually worth the price as you get a lot of courses, but only the sashimi stood out as it was delicious and so fresh that it melted in my mouth! The sashimi is my favourite dish out of the ENTIRE meal... none of our other dishes stood out at all.. they did not taste fresh and to be honest, very bland. The beef carpaccio had barely any sauce on it but for some reason, had such a strong and weird after taste that my partner only managed 2 bites LOL. I've dined at many sushi restaurants and have had way better quality and fresh sushi for less than half the price at Miku..

Service was pretty good. Our server was very sweet, made sure our waters were always filled and checked up on us a few times. It was just a bit hard to understand her when she was explaining the food items due to her accent but its not too big of a deal.. 

I don't recommend and don't plan to return to Miku... so much better sushi out there at a far better price.",0
402,"The decor is nice and the atmosphere feels right, but this place lacked a bit of service attention. 

We dropped by for a quick bite as we love Mexican food. We ended up ordering the fajitas for two. It was a large portion of meat (we got chicken and chorizo mix) but there were only 5 (five) tiny tortillas... that didn't make sense to me. 2 or us, lots of meat, but very few tortillas...we asked and we had to pay to get more, which I thought was not reasonable. I didn't get more cause I'm cheap. Also, we got a tiny container of sour cream. 

Overall it felt like they offered very little in terms of condiments. 
I waited a good 5-10 minutes to get more napkins and some hot sauce (Something good and spicy) but no luck. I ended up getting up and walking to the front to ask for it. Overall the service wasn't great. 
The fajitas were good but nothing out of this world. The selection of Mexican beers was also limited. 
We will have to keep looking for the ultimate Mexican Food place!",0
1740,"Unfortunately, this area does not have any other nearby places for dim sum. So there are no competitive prices for morning dim sum, and the food itself is not the best, when compared to restaurants in Markham, etc. However, considering this is the only place available, I think it's a good option when you're craving dim sum and do not want to commute or drive for an hour.

We tried the seafood dumplings (very doughy), fish congee (really nice), fried shrimp dumplings (tasty, essentially fried har gow), and spinach dumplings (very doughy). I do not eat meat and so didn't try the siu mai, tripe and pepper short rib, but heard that the latter two were quite tough and chewy. 

The staff was very friendly and accommodating. If we're in the area again and hungry for dim sum, I would come back, but it would not be my first choice. Most dishes were $4-5, and our bill came to $40 total.",2

It's ABSURDLY loud, can't hear the person next to you talking; get ready to scream your order out. Most of the food was fine to not good but some of the things that I did find pretty delicious was the buta kakuni, miso black cod (albeit way too bones), and the yaki udon.

The karrage had too much batter and was hella dry, salmon oshizushi was bland, takoyaki and okonomiyaki was really w/e.

Basically I've had the same dishes better and at a reasonable volume at other places. Kinka is ultimately a turn up spot and if you treat it as such you won't be disappointed.",1
1789,"Location: poor atmosphere, looks like the cliche Chinese restaurant right out of a movie. No eye appeal whatsoever. 

Food: ordered the chicken fried rice and the beef with ginger and spring onions. Being used to eating foods flavored with haberno peppers, we had them make our dishes spicy. The rice was very flavorful and nicely spiced. The beef dish was ok, didn't really stand alone well but mixed with the rice It was good. The water cups looked really dingy, which I didn't drink out of it Bc of that reason. 

Overall: food was good, if you don't mind the appearance of the place, I'd say go for it.",1
1474,"With lots of businesses closing at 6pm, I'm grateful dumpling house is open late, until 10:30pm on a week night!

Since the lockdown, I've ordered their vegetarian frozen dumpling, filled with greens and diced tofu, their frozen green onion pancake and their takeout braised eggplant and sautéed green beans.

As a disclaimer, eggplants are probably my favourite things to eat, and i love how buttery it is here at Dumpling House. Just yummy! As for the sautéed green beans, FYI they are seasoned with lots of minced garlic and a spicy and tangy bean sauce. Proceed with caution if you can't take too much heat! Otherwise, to me its just mildly spicy. 

Love having this in the neighbourhood, a great spot that I'll definitely visit, hope to dine in soon!",1
731,"This is a very cute restaurant in the heart of Yorkville on the corner of Yorkville Avenue. 

Like most of the reviewers, I went for the popular dish, Malafalde di Funghi. This pasta dish tasted as good as it looked. It's creamy and the pasta was al denté. 

We sat on the main floor, which was buzzing on Friday afternoon. Next time, I'd like to check out the rooftop patio when the weather is nicer. 

The price is mid to higher end, which I'm not crazy about. And after reading other people's reviews, the taste for other highlighted dishes seemed more conflicted (less consensus -except for the dish I got), so this wouldn't be a go-to spot for me. 

Atmosphere is on point. It's not stuffy like most of the restaurants in Yorkville. It feels homey.

The server we had was super busy, but he did what he needed to do. He was very on point with pouring our champagne and always made sure our glasses were filled. 

Overall, it was a pleasant experience.",1
1421,"2.5 stars. Nice casual ambiance. The tasting menu is around $190 for two, after tax and tip. I was let down by the food. They have a tendency of using very strong flavours that were overwhelming and competing with each other.

For instance, the pea dumpling had black truffle, bone marrow, and bacon. I wish I could have tasted the pea filling and bone marrow more because that was quite delicious, but it was overpowered by the more dominant flavours.

The wontons in sweet chili sauce was my least favourite dish. It was way too sweet (desensitized my tasting buds for the next dish), and the wonton wrappers mushy and falling apart.

The tacos were doused in aioli and it made the whole thing just taste like spicy mayo.

The fresh leaf wrap was very good and texturally interesting.

I didn't think the tofu ""cheese"" Caprese salad was anything special, but the tomatos were nicely peeled to soak in the dashi.

The smoked duck is a smart menu item because it can be prepared ahead of time and has a longer shelf life, can be served cold (well it was served cold to us so I assume that's intentional). The downside is that the fat is not rendered at all. and cold duck fat can be very rubbery. The skin was also unpleasant. It was not similar to a duck prosciutto where the fat is tasty and thinly sliced. The purple potato mash was very boring.

The ""famous fried rice"" tasted purely of black truffle oil, so if you like truffle you'll enjoy this. Thankfully there were no other competing flavous. I didn't think it was special. I think dousing things in truffle oil is a bit of a copout.

Our server was very nice, but he was quite busy. We had to wait a long time for water sometimes, and the sparking water cups are so tiny that I was constantly running out. No  pitcher or bottle for the table. Time between dishes is also long.

Overall I don't regret coming here, but I'm not sure if I'd come back. The value for the quality of food was not worth it for me. It certainly was interesting to try once.",0
811,"Disappointed. 
Good service but not so good food. The pasta was so tough to the point of being uncooked!  the bread was good.",0
816,"I was in shock with food here...the food was extremely disappointing. For prices that are on par with most mid-range Italian restaurant, the food was horrible.
 
I came here with reservations and we were seated immediately. It was during dinner hours but they only had one staff serving all the tables. With just one server, the service was really slow from bringing us the menus and taking down our orders. 
 
Service:
 
The service was slow since they don't have many staff. 
 
Food:
 
My friend and I ordered two appetizers and two entrees to share. Out of the four items we ordered, only one of the item was decent with the rest being disappointing. 
 
N'duja bruschetta - We were deciding to order a bruschetta and opted for this one because it was different. The menu described this to be a bruschetta with a spicy pork sausage spread drizzled with honey. Although I was aware that this was going to be just a spread on bread, it looked disappointing when it arrived to the table because the spread was so thin. I was expecting something thicker to give it more flavor.  I also looked at other tables bruschetta and it looked very average.
 
Calamari Fritti - Another disappointing appetizer. When this arrived, I was a bit shocked because it didn't even look like there was batter... When my friend and I tried it, we both agreed that there wasn't enough crisp. The dish didn't look appetizing either.  
 
Gnocchi Gorgonzola - I wanted to try the gnocchi since the menu states they are handmade. The pasta came out and I thought the color was unappealing; it was like a greenish/greyish color. I guess it is because this sauce is a nutty creamy sauce. The texture of the gnocchi was chewy and nice. However, I wasn't a fan of the sauce.
 
Tagliatelle al Funghi Misti - This was AWFUL Some of the noodles were stuck together and this is the first time I've experienced this at a restaurant. The menu does mention this is a lighter sauce, and I thought it was a lighter flavor....but I didn't expect it to be less saucy.  There was BARELY any sauce actually.  The sauce was pretty much nonexistent and I felt like eating noodles in water. This pasta had no taste. It was $18 and it was literally just plain noodles without much sauce and flavor; the pasta was very dry. 
 
Overall:
 
I would never return. With most of their pastas ranging from $17-20, I was expecting similar quality to other restaurants in this price range. The tagliatelle was so dry and awful. The bruschetta also barely had any toppings on it.",0
143,"I'm very confused on the tacos we received vs all these amazing reviews...

First timers at Kensington so we decide on this taco joint because Seven Lives was too long around 1:30p. 5 small tacos come in an order and you can only mix and match Al Pastor, Tinga and Chorizo. So we decided to get 2 Tinga and 3 Al Pastor. The tacos literally came out in 2 minutes after ordering. Too quick :3 The taste was bland and unappealing.

I've just attributing this negative review to a bad day at El Trompo...",0
909,"Went for the 4-6 aperitivo where you get a token to fill a small plate with food for every alcoholic beverage you order. Love the concept except wish they had some non alcoholic drinks options as well (not everyone drinks!)... you can add $5 if you order a nonalcoholic drink but still want the plate of food. The drinks are all around $15... a little pricey but expected. Although you can get beer for $7. The food was pretty decent, the flatbread and lemon ricotta were my faves. Service was pretty bad though... no one checked on us. And my friend who came late and ordered didn't get her drink until like 20 min later. No one seemed to be at the bar making her drink until we reminded them and no apologies given.",1
711,"Went on a Monday, came right at opening and they quickly filled up to full house of happy diners within the hour. Having finally experienced the hype, can safely say it's worth it! There's the option of doing a 50/50 split platter if you're indecisive like me, which two of us ordered a veal parm/gnocchi platter and their burrata to share. Burrata was on a bruschetta based, thick cut of garlic-y bread with all that cheese  The veal parm was tender and coated with mozz, gnocchi was fresh and soft, along with the Aperol spritz - such a good meal 
.",2
540,"Went there on a Sat night at 6pm for dinner before a movie.  
On the plus side the service was reasonably good.  
On the minus side:
1. The prices were much higher than the menu on their website.  This was misleading.
2. The food was small in both flavour and quantity.  

There are far better Mexican restaurants in the area.",0
1919,"This is hands down the best noodle place in Toronto!! The Beef Hot and Dry Noodles are delicious and perfect, and the portion sizes are big and leave you very satisfied. They also have bubble tea! 

I have gone here many times for lunch and dinner and each time the service was amazing and the restaurant is very clean. It is also in a trendy area of the city that has a lot of cafes. They also sell duck neck and duck wings, which are very famous delicacies in China, this is the only restaurant in Toronto I know that makes them and it is delicious!",2
1683,"Cute concept, but the toppings are absolutely horrible! The price is very very low, but I found myself paying less for great food in Chinatown so the low price does not play any factor here.

The toppings to be put into the broth are of the lowest quality. The meat is severely freezer burned and sort of breaks apart in the broth once cooked. Their sausage also tastes like couch medicine in liquid form.. why? Fudao seemed like the perfect place on a freezing Toronto night for me to warm up, but I regretted my decision more and more with each bite that I took.",0
290,"This place use to be good, but not anymore. The tacos tasted the same, hardly any chicken was found in my ""chicken burrito,"" and $11.95 + tax for a few SMALL pieces of calamari. I won't be returning.",0
182,"So I'm from San Diego. It is VERY hard for me to find anything even close in taste and quality.

This place has high ratings on here, so we decide to take a shot.

I regret that decision. I ordered three tacos (beef, pastor, carnitas.) The beef tasted like beef jerky, the pastor was super dry and bland, the carnitas tasted like cat food. 

Also you can't just order a small side of chips. It's $10 nachos or $11 guacamole (does it come with chips? Who knows?!)

Super disappointed. Literally had to get boba tea immediately after to cleanse the pallet.",1
1839,"Taste: Amazing and authentic. Definitely 5/5 on this. I mostly order bbq pork but sometimes I'll get the roasted pork. Bbq pork has a sweet savory taste to it, while the roasted pork has a crunchy skin with a soft meat to go with it. If you're sensitive to the sauces and tastes of authentic Chinese cuisine, I suggest ordering the roasted pork instead (and try a friend's bbq pork first before committing to it).

Price: Also 5/5. Cheap - what more do you want?

Service: My experinces, despite my lack of Chinese, has been very friendly with the workers. Yeah, the interior sucks but you're literally just there to order and get out so I don't see much of an issue. Though, it is quite unclean considering they serve food.

Portion: Now this is where my 4 star rating comes from. I agree with the other reviewers that they're cheap and the portions are quite filling. However, their MEAT portions are ridiculously inconsitent. Rice is just a filler to make you feel like there's a lot but you're not going there to pay for rice. As indicated by my picture, that day was a great day. Super filled with meat. On bad days it was maybe half of that or even less because they spread it around to make it look bigger. 

In conclusion: Great authentic Chinese bbq for the price and portion OF RICE, but expect inconsistencies with the meat portion. Don't expect to come here to dine and have a nice flashy interior. Go somewhere else to eat. CASH ONLY.",2
1001,"Gotta come check out this place if you love all things italian! Eataly is a grand building with restaurants, grab and go foods, gelato desserts, grocery store, and marketplace with fresh cheese, meats and more.

Their FRESH PASTA are absolutely HEAVENLY! Every layer of flavours was balanced to perfection! Their high quality food tasted so fresh, and every bite was delicious. Recommend making a reservation at the restaurant prior to going in because the live wait time can go up to 1hr depending on the rush hour line ups. The best thing that I love about this place is that you can buy the exact sauce and authentic ingredients from what was served at the restaurant right in the grocery market next to the restaurant!! How cool is that! 

Don't forgot to save your stomach for a scoop of their awesome gelato! The tiramisu flavour and the pistachio flavour were so unique and definitely two of our top favourites. They also have other cool desserts worth checking out too, like cannoli, tiramisu cake, chocolate and so much more.",2
269,"Casual, small place but conveniently located near the tiff building and Princess of Wales and Royal Alexandra theatres.
Lots of taco options and they do offer 1 or 2 vegan taco options. The shells are corn so gf.
you have to go up some stairs from the street to get in so not sure if there is an accessible entrance.
Make a reservation during TIFF.",1
1360,Ordered the salmon lover and red tuna maki through Ubereats and unfortunately got food poisoning from my order.,0
1776,"Dim sum in the heart of Yorkville, honestly coming from Richmond Hill (read: right beside Markham!) I wasn't expecting much. I expected average, bland tasting classics like har gow (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (steamed pork bites wrapped in wonton-like skin). We arrived as a table of 7 on a weekday and the place was fairly empty - understandable, dim sum usually is a longer meal not favoured for a workday lunch hour. We ordered a bit of everything and some of us were looking for specific items - everyone found what they were looking for! There were a decent variety and many classics on the menu - some that aren't often found even in Markham because they're complex to make and don't sell for high prices.

The highlights were the fritter wrapped in rice roll, the osmanthus cake, and the mini octopus in curry sauce. Often the rice rolls are squishy and lack texture, but this one was a good consistency that complemented the crunchy (not chewy!) dough fritter. The osmanthus cake came with a base layer of coconut milk, providing additional flavour and texture that agreed with the table's demands for desserts that're not too sweet but still *something*. We also ordered steamed sponge cake - it was soft and fluffy, steaming hot. The realization the sponge cake was steamed baffled some, and the softness and light flavour was well received. It could've had more of the signature taste, but it was a decent attempt at the classic.

Overall for the location I was pleasantly surprised, and prices were aligned to the area as well. Unfortunately from a dim sum in Toronto perspective, I didn't feel like it was anywhere close to great and it definitely wasn't worth the price paid. Service was good and accommodating to the non-Chinese speakers, but translations were odd and made it more difficult to understand what things were in some cases. I'll be back for team lunches looking for exotic options and a group feeling because we're all at a round table, but aside that I'll stick with my suburb options.",1
1468,"My friend and I were in the area, craving Chinese food, and didn't want to walk too far, so we came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The restaurant is nice on the inside and well kept. The waitstaff are friendly enough and pretty attentive. The food is pretty overpriced though and lacks flavor.

My friend ordered the green onion pancake and wonton soup. I had the spicy beef noodle soup. The green onion pancake was average, but the wonton soup broth had pretty good flavor. There were only three small wontons though, which my friend wasn't happy about. I wish the beef noodle soup had some flavor - it tasted like spicy and mildly salty water, which was surprising given how rich the soup looked. The noodles had a nice springy-ness to them, and there was A LOT of beef. I usually complain there isn't enough beef in my noodle soups, but I couldn't finish all the beef in my soup this time!

I'd consider taking friends here if they've only grown up on burgers their whole life and want to try Asian cuisine (maybe bring some spice packets along...), but I would not recommend this place to people who want authentic Chinese food. Take a 25 minute walk to Spadina Avenue instead.",1
1338,"Well my wife and I finally got around to try the new location of Khao San Road on Charlotte St. I love the decor and design of this location very interesting use of space, at first I thought there was only maybe room for about 20 people but as our server took us around the corner there was more seating for about another 20 to 30 people. The ambiance is really loud here and the back tables are mainly long high tops so plan to share with other people. 

The service is ok nothing too over the top but I give them a benefit of a doubt cause it was lunch time and it was full house and the servers were all running around. It didn't take long to flag our server down for some additional napkins, however our water glasses were empty and no one came around to refill until we asked. 

The food was ok as well we had ordered the Garlic Tofu and Garlic Chicken to start. Both appetizers were very crunchy and crispy the garlic taste was a bit muted in my opinion both also come with a ramekin of the typical Thai sweet chili dipping sauce. Very crunchy exterior which locked in all the juice inside.

I ordered the Pad Gra Prao with beef add $1 and fried egg add $1 which is basically a dry curry with beef, red peppers, onions, red and green chili peppers and also a perfectly cooked sunny side up egg on top of white jasmine rice. I found that the beef was slightly too salty and too dry. Overall 3.5 / 5 for me. 

We also ordered the Khao Soi which is a soup noodle with egg noodles in a curry based soup. We opted to get the beef option for an additional $1. The presentation was really nice flavours were good slightly on the sweet side for my liking but when lime juice is added the flavour sort of balanced itself out. I think this is a 4 / 5 for me.

Overall just another Thai restaurant in the city that serves authentic Thai food. But didn't really blow me away.

FeiJai Out!",1
504,"I was very excited about trying Quetzal. Upon arrival the ambiance was great, with candlelit tables and a curved ceiling, like being inside of a ship. The bar seating was inviting and the drinks menu was inventive and cocktails were superior with great notes for sipping.

For the food we did the tasting menu, since there were many unique dishes that we wanted to try. The sea bream and scallop ceviche was underwhelming, with the scallops being were quite small and not fresh tasting. The other sushi grade fish - the kanpchi tiradito - was good in comparison. The thin crispy Masa round was similar to a taco pizza, and a fun app to share. 

Next up, the kale salad was tasty and served with the full stems. The bone marrow came with two large bones but didn't seem to have enough flavour cooked into it. Lastly, the skirt steak and 18oz rib eye were served. We were never asked how we liked it cooked when ordering, but we received medium rare which worked out to our tastes. 

Overall, great value for a lot of food and high quality ingredient based dishes, but nothing stood out at the end of the night. I was hoping for a little more bite. 

It's a beautiful restaurant otherwise, and maybe I'm just not the right fit for palette.",1
805,"So far Scallop and Foie Gras Appetizer was the best. Ordered appetizer size of of Seafood Pasta dish. The pasta was super al dente, to the point of being tough. The one one mussel I had was gross but the lone shrimp was good, as  was the calamari. 
Hubby's steak was good but my lamb chops left much to be desired. I prefer the taste of Australian or New Zealand lamb and I forgot to ask where it was from.",1
1236,"One of the oldest restaurants that I had been to. Since North York. It's always been a great experience with them! No matter was the lunch hours having great lunch sets and yummy fish; but also the dinner are always pretty impressive. The late snacks are pretty good too! 
Don't forget to try their cocktails if you drink! 
Overall a pretty good experience there although sometimes is too noisy to talk with frds",1
1071,"My family and I decided to choose La Vecchia for my mini wedding dinner, as my cousin had recommended it to us so we decided to have a go and try it out. 

The place had a very nice atmosphere, very nice with cute decors. The food was pretty good, it was flavourful with a good portion size and at a reasonable price. 

Our server just seemed like he didn't want to be there. Maybe he was too busy? Or had a rough day? So I kept it positive, didn't mention anything until my other family members almost everyone noticed as well. It was my dinner night where as I was busy talking to my family members so I've missed when he was offering cheese to the pastas. I apologized and asked if he was able to bring the cheese back again, never came back with the cheese. Overall just got a very bad vibe. We had another younger server come by to collect our plates and he had a much better attitude and was certainly polite. 

I've also told the server if we could do the bill 4 ways, it was my fault I meant everyone to themselves and asked politely if he was able to change it. The response I got was ""no it has already been done and can't change it."" Left me with such a terrible feeling to my gut that now everyone overpaid for what they haven't ordered. It was my fault I'll take it but correct me if I'm wrong? The bill can't be redone? Anyways to the end of our dinner, the server all of a sudden became friendly as the bills were being handed out. 

It was certainly a day to remember, but to keep it positive I just let it go and remembered the good food and great conversations with my family members.",1
1861,"Artisan Plus received a great amount of hype upon opening on IG and I've been waiting to try it since.

AMBIANCE: 5/5
The store itself is small but functional. The seating is very well designed with ample room in between each table and each chair has it's own cubby to leave purses/shopping bags in. The decoration itself gives the restaurant a really nice modern, chic vibe and great for IG pics!

FOOD: 3/5
I ordered their famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian with Beef: this comes with scrambled eggs, tomatoes, carrots, zucchini, organic cloud ear mushroom, five spice tofu, edamame, and potato. The dish came with thick ribbon noodles which were THICK, chewy, and filling.
The plate was okay but a little underwhelming from how much hype was given. The sauce was a little plain and I was expecting more of a savory flavor. Because there was such a variety I believe they only put a little of each so it makes the dish seem insubstantial. 

SERVICE: 5/5
The service is really attentive here. The server was friendly and advised of spice levels of the dish (my friends CANNOT handle spicy). Water was always refilled and the food came out hot and fast. Bills came quickly and easily split.

OVERALL: 3/5
I feel like this was a solid but average experience. I'll be back in the future to try other things on the menu!",1
411,"Tried to go here for our anniversary. No one acknowledged us at the door for quite a while. When the gentleman finally asked for how many and we answered three, he told us 5 min. There were several open tables, not sure why we had to wait, especially since I'm visibly disabled. 

There was one table for two available at the front, and we watched him futz with it and add a third placemat to an already crowded table. When he motioned us over (he didn't come get us, just beckoned) I had to try to explain to him that this table was not suitable as my leg wouldn't fit. He said it was for three. I asked if we could have a four top. He said none were available. I tried again to explain that I'm handicapped and wouldn't fit at this tiny table. 

Let me be clear, there were other available tables, but they were 6 tops, and he didn't want to lose the seats. I offered to wait for a four top but he said he couldn't tell me how long that would be. 

So we left. So much for hospitality. He was rude and dismissive and I won't waste the drive again. We went next door to the seafood restaurant. It was fabulous.",0

Last visit lunch two other tables only 2 waiters .

Ordered apps nachos with guacamole and beans .

Ordered water with ice did not ever arrive . Taco was okay but not what it used to be .

It is an open seating arrangement with 4 large picnic tables and the food carts around it. It was a nice sunny, windy day, perfect to get some spicy food.  Between the three of us we got

CHICKEN TEQUITA: a deep fried taco with guacamole and chicken. Could have been slightly more spicy. It was well marinated. 

CARNITAS TORTAS: this was delicious, a big CARNITAS loaded sandwich served with some nachos on the side. 

I like my Mexican to be slightly more spicy and a little more tangy, this was alright but I have had better and would keep experimenting till I find the flavor.",1
1351,"Khao San Road is one of the better Thai establishment in Toronto. The atmosphere can be a little loud, so it may not the best option if you are seeking a place to chat. There are great vegan options! The restaurant can also make special accommodation if you have a specialty diet. 

Food is fresh and delicious! Most items such as pad thai sam roas ($14.95) with rice noodles, tamarind, tofu, bean sprout, fresh roasted peanuts, dried chili, lime, long leaf cilantro and pad kee mao ($14.95) with wide rice noodles, long green pepper, bamboo shoot, mushroom, thai basil, red bell pepper, faux oyster sauce substitute, soy sauce are made to order. It's great for a quick lunch if you manage to secure a seat. 

Nom! Hot delicious pad thai! Yes! Get in my pad belly now! 

Pro tip: visit right when Khao San Road opens at 11:30 to avoid the wait!",2

I ordered the pad Thai and my boyfriend ordered the pad gra prow. I can't have spicy so I ordered no spice. You have the option of adjusting the spice level. My boyfriend got medium spice for his dish. He cleaned his plate good and ended up finishing mine. Portions were good for the price. Plates range starting from $15-16. Quality and flavors were there so it was a good meal. We loved the playlist they were playing and the ambiance. It was pretty loud in there with the music playing and the crowd, but we enjoyed our meal. Servers gave us great and fast service!",2
1867,"Sooooooo. Good. No joke, I visited this restaurant and came back for more only 2 days later.

I am so glad that regional Chinese cuisine is exploding onto Toronto's food scene. Don't get me wrong, dim sum is alright, but biang biang noodles are where it's at.

And they are so damn good here. Thick handmade noodles, enveloped in warm sweet and savoury sauce, and served with a generous variety of toppings -- it's just so comforting. I inhaled everything on my plate in record time. I think the $13.99 price point is fair.

The other standout for me was the Shuan Platter ($12.99). It's an appetizer sampler with enoki mushrooms, tofu sheets, and honeycomb tripe doused in chili sesame sauce. Just thinking about the tripe makes my mouth water -- the soft, chewy tripe was the perfect vessel for soaking up the rich sauce. Umami galore.

Pretty much everything else we've tried so far has been delicious, except perhaps the shredded potato salad ($5.99, not pictured). It was a little too vinegary and not spicy enough for my taste, but still complemented the Jia Mo well.

The ambiance is definitely fast-paced during busy prime hours, so come during off peak periods (before 6 pm, after 8:30 pm) to skip the lineups. Service is quite good and, unlike similar restaurants, the servers speak fluent English.

Can't get enough of this place! Try it and thank me later.",2
1885,"My aunt recommended Lai Wah Heen Chinese Restaurant to us. There was options to order set menu (set price per person) as well order al carte options. It wasn't your typical dim sum restaurant as it didn't have push carts.

We ordered hot tea and shared eight dim sum dishes including Roast Pork Pastries, Steamed Shrimp Dumplings, Sticky Rice with Meats and Vegetables, Minced Beef and Mandarin Peel in Rice Roll, Chicken and Truffle Dumplings, Steamed Pork, Shrimp, and Scallop Siu Mai, Minced Beef Siu Mai, and Deep Fried Dumplings Filled with Berkshire Pork.

842,"Had a good dinner here last week! The interior is very traditional Italian and very cozy. Restaurant seems to be in an old house. There is a back patio as well a terrace on the third floor but we didn't get to check those out. 

The meal started with warm bread, we also got a caprese salad which i thought was just okay (tomatoes and basil weren't super fresh). My main was pappardelle with tomato sauce, shrimp and mushrooms. The best thing about the dish was how hot it was when it came out! It stayed hot for the entire time I was eating it which was awesome. I also loved the sauce which tasted very fresh and tomato-ey. The shrimp itself was kind of a letdown - it was a little overcooked and they also had the tails on which made it a little awkward to eat. Additionally, there seemed to be a couple pieces of shrimp shell in the pasta - the first time I ate a piece I thought it was maybe a tail I hadn't put off to the side but when it happened again I realized it was a piece of shell. My partner had the carbonara pasta which he said was just okay. For dessert we had tiramisu, it was delicious and a good portion for sharing. The meal was a little pricey, but everything is in Yorkville.

The service could have been better. We spent some time waiting to give our order and also to get water, and when the server did come by he seemed to be in a hurry. My partner felt bad since we'd come in without a reservation, and he wondered if they needed the table - but if the restaurant didn't have room for us, it's their responsibility communicate that - either tell us they don't have a table available or that we need to leave by a certain time. (Neither of those things were mentioned when we were seated.) Our entire meal was just over an hour long so we certainly weren't taking an unusually long time to eat.

Overall the meal was fine but next time I'll probably try one of the other italian restaurants in the neighbourhood!",1
918,"A cheerful relaxed place to grab a large bowl of hot pasta that will fill you up and keep you carb happy. The pasta isn't freshly made (I don't think so at least) but the addition of quality sauces and fresh ingredients still makes it one delicious meal. They make a mean sandwich also! 

Service was relaxed but prompt, probably to keep up with the peak hour crowds. Definitely worth it if all you want is some straight forward Italian.",1
1808,"Really good Northern Chinese restaurant. Came here with 2 friends and got the Lamb Pao Mo, Lamb noodles, and Beef Noodle Soup. They were all super filling, the noodles were handmade and really chewy. I would definitely come here again.",2
384,"Came for lunch around 12:30. The place only has two tables and some standing room. After you order and pay, they give you a number and  you seat yourself. 

The tacos all tasted good but were quite overpriced at 6 bucks each. The enchilada tasted good and was better priced at 8 bucks. 

I didn't feel the service was great, the cooks seemed annoyed when orders started piling up or when a customer asked for the provided cilantro/onions/ salsa to be refilled. Space wise the place sucks with only two tables. They also said there was not bathroom for customers ( even though if we paid). Floors and tables were not clean either. 

I also asked their facebook page a few days before my saturday visit if they have tamales. It's on the menu and some reviews on other review sites mentioned they are not usually available. I got a reply within 1 hour that they would have tamales around noon. When I asked about them, i was told they make them some weeks and not others. I do not think they are worth returning to. There are other taquerias in the city that have cleaner restaurants and friendlier staff. Take out might be ok.",1
1215,"This place is a small hole in the wall and worth visiting if you crave some good old fashioned tacos rather than the commercial stuff.. portion sizes were good however the flavours were slightly missing for me.. 

I would visit them again if I was in the area, but not necessarily my go to place. Please don't let my review deter you from trying their tacos though, they are still pretty good. 

Flavours can be very subjective and this place is definitely worth a try.. but if you know and love tacos and taco culture as much as me, then you would also know that everyone has their own go to spot.. 

This place has great service, friendly staff and a small seating area if you just want to eat quickly or grab'n'go.",1
382,"I don't usually UPDATE a review; Friday was a disaster.
The owners should provide the staff/customers AIR CONDITIONING, they are sweating into the grill it's so hot (flavour to the tacos?).
The time it took to get 2 tacos was LONG.  Poor interior design, cluttered.  1 of 2 tacos went into the trash (very under cooked).  The tables are cluttered in garbage, food scraps.  They make enough money, pay a teenager to clean.  This place needs HELP.
It was one of those experiences where I'll try other spots on St Clair, over Itacate.",0
1186,"Some hits and many misses; 
Always sad when slow/ inattentive or simply bad service ruins great dishes. However, the setting, the space, and the wine list are great. 

The food: although executed greatly leaves something to be desired in flavour. Simple ingredients are supposed to speak for themselves here mostly, however more ""cooked"" dishes lacked savoury or original flavours that would make you go back for specific dishes. 

The good:  Cacio e pepe is great- am I running back for it anytime, maybe. 
The disappointing: Avoid the Branzino (sea bass) if you have a problem with bones- they make no effort in deboning it before serving. 

The main issue here is service. It was exceptionally slow; had to call the staff several time for refills, orders, more wine, where's our food... etc. T
he timing between each course needed to be shortened but half if not more. I don't think they want you sitting there for 3 hours without dessert even. There were too many loooong pauses during meal staring at an empty table waiting for another round of dishes. 

With lots of great Italian options in the city I would definitely consider it more like a wine bar with a few nibbles rather than a full fledged hearty meal.",1
836,"Honestly, I don't know how this place averages 4.5 stars. My review would have been a 3.5 had it not been for the horrible service. 

My party made a reservation for about 12 people and we were given the room upstairs where other parties were dining as well. The layout and spacing in this restaurant are very tight so watch your step. The seating in the front doesn't quite make sense layout wise. When I walked up to the stairs me and an employee were basically dancing around each other to just get by each other...just why.

Our server the entire night honestly had an attitude problem. He basically had a stick up his ***. He was passive aggressive the minute we got there all the way to the end. He asked if we wanted appetizers and since we were waiting on a few people we asked for a couple of minutes. Unlike a regular waiter who would walk away and let you discuss he stood there hovering and just waiting for us to give him an answer before leaving. Even when he was putting dishes down he was just dropping them and tossing side plates here and there, it was completely unprofessional. It was time for pasta and while our waiter dished out the cheese another waiter helped with pepper. But the pepper waiter took a little longer than the cheese and you could hear our waiter yelling at the pepper waiter from the other room. Is this not supposed to be a classy environment? Why are you yelling at him in front of all the customers? 

Aside from the horrible service, the food was actually very good and the portions were huge! I ordered the Spaghetti Mare de Mario and the amount of seafood definitely did not disappoint! There were a ton of mussels but the spaghetti was not fully cooked. I had a chunk of it still stuck to each other and hard...

Overall I do not think this place deserves the rating it has based on this experience.",0
54,"When the urge for Mexican strikes there is not much in this world that can keep me from finding some.

We ended up giving this place a shot mainly due to proximity to where we were and I must say, we are so lucky to live in a city with so many options like this.

Though I wouldn't have called my mean authentic it definitely tasted great! 

The food was more american-mexican style, portions were generous and the ambiance was mexi-fun with random southern trinkets strewn about the place in a dimly -but not too dimly- lit location.

It has the usual items you would expect to find in this kind of restaurant with their own twists, flavors and sauces that I myself think we're too notch.

Though the place was a little small (it's Toronto, what can you do) it never felt cramped and we had more than enough space to eat and chill.

Once we left I felt stuffed which is #1 most important for me and even then we were already planning our next trip here.

If you are in the mood for mexi-american fare, look no further and give this joint a try the next time that Mexican urge comes-a-knockin",2
478,"Would give the drinks a 4/5. Extremely slow wait (~14 minutes to get our drinks). Also asked to remove agave from one of our drinks and the waiter did not communicate that properly to his bar tender - so we got stuck with agave in one of our drinks even though we asked to remove it. 

Not worth the wait. Take your business elsewhere. Did not try the food so I can't give any insight to that.",1

818,"Trattoria taverniti is a little place in Little Italy downtown. Staff are very nice and the decorations are very homie. I ordered the rigatoni bolognese and the pasta is uncooked but that's how it is served but it was very good ! The flavor was good the sauce was just right and there was lots of meat in it! My friend ordered the spaghetti and it was a bit salty for him and it was uncooked a bit. The Quattro formaggi was good and very cheesy and oil ! 
The only bad thing was the service it was very very slow. My friend finished his food before us and we had to wait about another 15-20 mins for our dishes to come. Also asking for water took a while to get their attention because they were all zooming by the tables. 

Overall though the food here is quite good but a little pricey",1
1003,"A group of us went for dinner at La Piazza within Eataly. Note this restaurant's dishes are meant to be like tapas and a shared family style - about the size of appetizers. We ordered aranchini, marinated mackerel (scombro), a white (quattro formagi) and a red pizza (bufalo), spinach ricotta ravioli (quadrati), and the rainbow trout entree with fingerling potatoes. Our favorites were the quadrati (al dente with a flavorful creamy filling and lemony sauce to cut the richness), the aranchini (so creamy & cheesy!), and the rainbow trout which was cooked to perfection with a crispy skin. The scombro was very good as well. Extremely underwhelming was the pizza which we wouldn't recommend; the white cheese pizza was sparse on the cheese and very dry, and while the bufalo had more flavour due to the tomato sauce is was soggy/spongy. 

Service was excellent and attentive without being invasive - and our lovely server corrected an ordering error I made without fuss or hesitation when I accidentally ordered the wrong pizza. We were not charged for it which was really appreciated, given it was our first time there and an honest mistake. 

And the whole of Eataly is just fun to eat and shop your way through. Recommend for a great night out!",1
1823,"Without question the worst cashew nut chicken I ever unfortunately ordered...
Smaller than most restaurants portions, to top it off; $18.01 for garbage food.
There are many WRONGS in this world; a bad meal is pretty low in the grand scheme of things/life.  BUT; a garbage meal is still a garbage meal.  Staff looked miserable, absolutely unpleasant.  I don't need an ass-kissing or TLC at a fast food Chinese restaurant, this was depressing.  Waste of money, waste of time.",0
39,"Gringo af. Lunch and dinner lines go out the door. Don't come here for your undersalted chips and measly-portioned guac. The meat was kind of too salty and even having three tacos made me want a fourth. I guess it's FINE that there's fish tacos but it's kind of overrated. Where is the cilantro?!?! 

I have had better. It's got an Assembly Chef's Hall vibe. It's loud, jammed full of working professionals. Only come here if everything else is closed.",1
809,"I have frequently gone by this restaurant, and was curious to try it out. I dined here for a business meeting with several of my colleagues.

The ambiance and decor is elegant and romantic overall, and the staff are very welcoming and hospitable.

Carisma has been an establishment in Toronto for years, and I was eager to try it out based on recommendations.

Upon entering, I was greeted by very hospitable staff. The restaurant was entirely empty upon my arrival, which I found to be unusual given that it was peak dinner time.

Our server was attentive and knowledgeable and had great recommendations about specials that evening and the menu. 

My colleague and I decided to share the Grilled Calamari appetizer, which was quite flavorful in nature with the addition of olives and herbs. Although I didn't partake in the bread, my colleague mentioned that it was quite soft and delicious overall!

For our entrees, we ordered the SeaBass Filet which according to my companion was well-seasoned and delicious overall; another colleague asked for a 'surprise' entree and was presented with a combined dish of the gnocchi and agnolotti, which she enjoyed. My entree was the ahi tuna dish which I was excited about; however, I must admit that this was overdone. It was presented as an entire tuna steak, which was likely the issue in the cook overall, as had it been sliced tuna, there may have been more control over the cook. I had asked for it to be rare, and it was far more than well-done, and even charred on one side. 

Overall, I am glad that I tried this establishment. I commend the staff and service for their efforts.",1
923,"Can't say enough about Fusaros! An affordable and delicious Italian spot in the heart of Toronto, it's one of my staples. I've eaten in, taken out, and even come for just a bottle of wine (which is super affordable at $25 a bottle).

I'm a sucker for their bolognese but before I found my go-to I had tried their Italian sausage pasta and a few of their pizzas. Everything is delicious.

It is somewhat on the simpler side but at the price point it's at, I wasn't expecting something over the top fancy. It's essentially a better and more delicious version of the pasta you'd make yourself at home. Which is nice.. that comfort food .

It's also on the smaller side in terms of location size but maybe it's a hidden gem or something - I've never had any issues getting a table regardless of the day or time I've visited.",2
66,"An unassuming little spot in a strip mall known for some great food, and this Mexician restaurant is right at home with its neighbors. 

We had the chorizo burrito, pulled pork chimichanga, and a horacha to wash it all down. The burrito came wrapped simply but was toasted to perfection and carried the perfect balance of meat, rice, beans and veggies. It was absolutely delicious and we wolfed it down even before the second dish showed up. I bit into the pulled pork chimichanga and wondered what was so impossibly creamy..... and I turned out to be the melt in the mouth pulled pork. So delicious.

Excellent service and friendly staff. They found it amusing that I was so happy to get my goblet of horchata and promptly got us everything we needed to enjoy our meal. A lovely neighbourhood gem.",2
1810,Really disappointed. We ordered two dishes and wait like an hour for the fish. Maybe it is because we did not order the right thing. But generally i would not go there again.,0
472,"I come here several times a year and its still the best! One of my favourite restaurants in Toronto. 

2 years ago they had a dish called the Love Boat which was one of my fav dishes but they discontinued it. I stopped coming as often because of that but decided to revisit for the guac! OH MY GOD. Best.Guac.Ever. They will crush and make the guac in front of you which is a cool personal touch. The flavour is just right! You can taste the hint of lime, the onions and tomatoes! To top it off, the chips they provide are to die for... 

I would also highly recommend the original margarita! One of my favs!! My friend and I once ordered a pitcher and both got pretty drunk off it haha! Perfect amount of tequila in each glass and overall just the perfect amount of sweetness. 

In terms of atmosphere, the inside is pretty dim with loud music. I've sat inside once and can say it is definitely an experience. I did the tasting menu that time, and i believe it was $65/person and you get to experience a bit of everything! Definitely worth it if you have the appetite, I was too full for the best part... the dessert... WHICH TO MENTION, WAS MY FAV PART! I have to talk about the churro.... LITERALLY THE BEST. Nice and thick, with a crunch, very warm, and also the perfect amount of cinnamon sugar! 

Taco portions are also huge. I think I can write an essay because I've tried almost everything on this menu. HIGHLY RECOMMEND",2
112,"Food was awful - worst tacos I've had in my entire life - the meat tasted funky like it had gone bad and was burnt. The rice was bland with zero seasoning. They never even brought out the app we asked for (but they did try to charge us for it). I have no idea how this place has so many high ratings, the only positive is the food is cheap (although even at this price point it's not worth it). Even the mojito was subpar.

Stay home and make your own - it'll probably taste like a Michelin restaurant in comparison.",0
1240,"For a party of 3, we ordered 3 set meals and 2 drinks, and we left with our stomachs pretty full. This is my 3rd time at this location, but unfortunately stars were docked off for quite an uncomfortable experience. 

Made a reservation for a party of 3 for 6:30pm on a Tuesday, what we were given was a small table for 2 with a small stool at the side of our table, with my back to the adjacent customers table at a corner, which essentially felt like I was in the middle of the walkway. Throughout the entire dinner, I had felt extremely awkward and uncomfortable as I had felt the waiters/waitresses' bodies touching mine every time they came by to serve food to the table behind me. We've requested 2 times, when the restaurant was not packed for a larger table, but nothing was to be done. Unsurprisingly, I felt like we were being rushed in finishing our plates one right after the other as there were no room at all to fit any dishes anymore. 

If we had proper seating and space, I believe the experience would have been that much greater.",1
660,"To be honest, when I walked into this small restaurant, I was shocked because it looked very small and outdated! It was quite sketchy. However, when the food was here,OMG! The seasoning of my lobster pasta is perfect! I was not a big fan of tomato sauce nor the carbs. But I forgot about my diet plan and had LOTs of pasta! My husband order the steak, which was seasoning perfect as well. The cut of meat was great and favour is right at the point. 
Well the only downside was the home made tiramisu, which was very disappointed. I had lots of different types of tiramisu in Italy and Italian restaurants. This one was definitely on the AVOIDLIST. 
However, I'll go back soon to try other dishes for sure!",2
790,"Had a delicious dinner here my first nite in Toronto. Beautiful space in an incredible historic building. We ordered lots of appetizers with my absolute favourite being the Funghi Assoluti (basked oyster mushrooms, parmigiano, bread crumbs, extra-virgin olive oil, balsamic vinegar, arugula,garlic). SO good! for my main, I chose the Spaghetti al Limone (spinach, capers, parmigiano reggiano shavings, lemon, extra-virgin olive oil). Literally one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. Our Braziluan waiter was wonderful & so sweet & attentive. Absolutely love this place!",2
1672,"If you dine at Fudao, you should expect a very generous portion of food (due to their unlimited noodle refill) for an extremely reasonable price. However, what stops me from giving this place a higher rating is that I didn't find myself wanting more throughout the meal. 

I tried the Fudao rice noodle and thai curry and Teppan grill squid skewer. I expected the squid to have a nice grilled/smoky taste but when it came to the table, it appeared to have just been boiled(?) and dipped in sauce. The rice noodle dish presentation is pleasant at first, but then you have to dump all the sides immediately into the boiling pot in order to have everything cooked properly. Once this is done, it becomes just like any other noodle dish. The meat was actually surprisingly soft/tender but only 3 pieces will come with the meal.

Regardless, Fudao does seem to be a popular restaurant in Toronto and was packed when I came, so perhaps it's worth a visit. Personally though, if I was back in town, I wouldn't go out of my way for it unless I just wanted to get full for a cheap price.",1
1357,"Once upon a time, I was really excited to try Miku when it finally came to Toronto. My friend ended up going before me and loved it, so we decided we would do -licious together. That was a disappointing experience so I never bothered going back. Overrated.  

Fast forward a few years later and I'm back again for winterlicious but now it's $53 for dinner. I have to say Miku is consistent. I felt the same way about the food as I did the first time - mediocre. Expectations were met, but only because I was expecting much to begin with. We were seated near the front and had a view of the kitchen. I was initially shocked by the amount of kitchen staff I saw but I guess that made sense because it's a pretty big restaurant and there was a steady flow of people.   

Signature Sushi Selection (Aburi Salmon Oshi, Aburi Ebi Oshi, Coal Harbour Roll, Red Wave Roll, Aburi Ebi Nigiri and ?) - Pretty cool that you get one of each because on their menu, you can choose only choose one type (nine pieces) for around $18. Unfortunately, the pieces were bland and the rice was a little hard, as if it's been sitting out for a while. When there was flavour, it was just the sauce. The best piece would be the Aburi Ebi Nigiri and the worst were the rolls. Very AYCE tasting tbh. 

Sablefish & Lobster Ravioli - Love sablefish and it's pretty hard to mess up but this was probably the worst sablefish I've ever had. It was much firmer than I'm used to, as in when I smacked it with a fork, it didn't budge. I didn't like the lobster ravioli and there was a piece of shell in the filling. The veggies were flavourless and definitely an afterthought. 

Green Tea Opera - It's a sever layer cake and each layer is different, though it really just tastes like chocolate and red bean. Cool, cool, cool, not important. The best part of this whole meal was the matcha ice cream. The texture was more like gelato imo, super smooth, next to no air pockets, very creamy. Perfect matcha flavour, strong in matcha but not bitter and just slightly sweet. Maybe because I just had it and it's fresh in my memory, but I think this might be the best matcha ice cream I've had. 

Grapefruit Basil Smash ($7) - I liked this. Would describe it as sophisticated grapefruit juice. Stir well before drinking or you wont get the ginger beer/spiced honey part until later. Maybe it's the cup but it was a lot bigger than I thought it'd be. 

No problems with the service. Bonus info, I overheard the table next to us ask the server for their version of a California roll and it sounds like they were able to accommodate.",1
735,"Enoteca is a nice spot with great drinks and great vibe to grab a bite and hang out with friends. I've driven by Enoteca a number of times and finally had the time to go check this place out. Located just west of Dundas and Dovercourt, you can't miss the massive doors. 

Service was great from start to finish, attentive and overall a good experience. However, the food was decent at best. The Cacio e Pepe was on the saltier side, so be ready for that. It was very rich in flavour, a pinch less of salt and this would be been wonderful. The charcuterie board was decent, although I must say that the cheese was really good. 

Best dish of the night goes to the arancini balls. Really nice and crispy on the outside, stringy and warm cheese on the inside. Drench it in the tomato sauce, you won't regret it.",1
1540,"It's an interesting concept to see for fast food dumplings. It wasn't bad nor was it really good, but it was perfectly fine for a quick grab and go lunch. 

They all look so delicious, but when it came out, it was clear that it was either made hours before and reheated or just has been sitting out for a while..none of our dumplings were piping hot, and neither was the Soup inside the soup dumplings, which was a bummer. 

The fried chicken was hot and good, but we also ordered the mini sesame balls that tasted a bit like there was some chemical in there and it wasn't fully cooked through-- super gross.",1
422,"It is pretty hard to find good Mexican food in Toronto ( at least veggie) and I'm not talking about the good ole beans and cheese on tortilla! Anyway, this restaurant is NOT in that ""off the hook"" food category.

1442,"Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a HK cafe (cha chaan teng) located in downtown Chinatown. Living in Scarborough, there are tons of HK cafe options in Upper Scarborough and Markham but surprisingly not many downtown that I'm aware of.

HK cafes (cha chaan tengs) serve low cost Canto-Western cuisine and this is a result of Britain's colonization of Hong Kong and as a result it ended up impacting the food served.

I have been to a Hong Kong Bistro Cafe a few times and dropped by recently on a late Friday afternoon during the holiday season. I ordered the lunch special which was a baked grouper in a tomato sauce over a bed of spaghetti, it also came with a soup (choice of Chinese soup, cream soup and Russian Borscht which is essentially a tomato soup) and a HK milk tea for $8.50 plus tax. The spaghetti was pretty basic but the baked grouper was cooked perfectly, really well done. The Russian borscht (tomato soup) soup was basic and the HK milk tea was above average.

Hong Kong Bistro Cafe is a pretty good option downtown if you are looking for a HK cafe and really reasonably priced and service is pretty fast. The food won't blow you away but it's pretty good and the portions are pretty big and fulfilling especially for the price point.",1
887,"We ordered three pasta dishes all of them were mediocre; lobster, vongole and octopus. Lacking flavor and pasta overcooked. Very skimpy on the seafood. Fail. Never again. Not worth the calories. Very disappointed and I'm a carb/pasta whore.",0

The one good thing on the menu is the risotto with the veal shank, but everything else we ordered was just okay. The waitress we had didn't listen well enough and took too long doing everything. We weren't even there on a particularly busy night, so the lack of good service can't be blamed on how packed the restaurant was. I would save the money and settle for somewhere else instead.",0
304,"I decided to check this place out during my never ending taco obsession phase. The patio looks pretty with twinkling lights and a mini fire pit on one of the middle tables. I came on 2 separate occasions & Chula did not disappoint! Both times I had the fried calamari appetizer, shrimp, fish & chicken tacos. The amount of food was filling because usually I could probably eat like 8 tacos and still be hungry. I'm not a fan of the location so I wouldn't go out of my way to visit, but I'd definitely come back if I were in the area.

I had the mussels which was quite tasty but a bit skimpy for the price. The veal marsala was pretty average at best. The other notable dish was the egg plant salad which is quite imaginative with a layer of pineapple in the middle. All in all, a pleasant experience but would not rush back.",1
483,"Updated to a 4 Star. :) Came back for some more tacos and they were very good

This is a tiny and homey place. It's the size of a small room and probably can't house more than 10-12 people but its charm makes up for its size. 

Unfortunately, our server did not understand English but luckily, a kind patron translated for us. Despite the language barrier, we did receive friendly service. Some of the other patrons even asked us how we located this place which is when we got to bring up the awesomeness of Yelp haha. :D 

The food was good but wasn't stand-out. I have had better gobernador tacos and chicken enmoladas elsewhere. I was also a little sad that there wasn't any salsa to put on the tacos so it was missing that spicy kick. However, the warm atmosphere has compelled me to return to try their other interesting dishes like the pressed pork in guajillo and their Mexican brunch. So I'd still be willing to return and who knows, you may expect to see an updated review sometime. :)",2

I tried to visit this place. The ambience is pretty nice and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. I went onto try their spaghetti. I didn't like it much as I felt it wasn't properly cooked plus it didn't have much flavor. I finished my meal with Caramel Coppetta dessert (Cookie Crunch Gelato with Roasted Peanuts) and Tiramisu. Tiramisu was again a let down but I loved the Caramel Coppetta. So, overall I would say the experience was pretty average.",1

The guacamole is served with a side of spiced nachos - they were a little dry and stale, but the guacamole was fresh. The ceviche is an European bass, with a nice kick of spice as well. I ordered the fish taco which was freshly deep fried and simply delicious. 

The restaurant has a patio with outdoor seating, as well as bench like seating for larger groups. Unfortunately, the service is not as great as the food thus meriting a 3 star.",1
1874,"Came to Lai Wah Heen with my family to try out their peking duck as I had received a coupon for a free order. Growing up in Scarborough and being completely surrounded by Chinese restaurants, and being Chinese myself, I've had my fair share of Chinese cuisine. Upon arrival, I knew right away it would be a different vibe as it was located inside a hotel and everything looked fairly nice. 

The staff was helpful and polite though a bit stiff. Nonetheless our order was accurate and the tea was always filled. We had dinner on a Tuesday night so it wasn't overly busy but there were some larger parties dining.

On to the food: so as I said, I'm Chinese and have grown up around eating this food in and outside of the house. We ordered about 9 dishes for 7 people including peking duck, stir-fried beef flavoured with aged mandarin peel, sweet and sour pork w/ lychee, gailon vegetables, pineapple chicken fried rice, soy sauce fried rice noodle with beef and fried chicken. First impressions, the food looked nice but was pretty small portions and cost a pretty penny more than what you get uptown. Not surprising with this being a downtown hotel restaurant. The taste though was really really good. Everything was delicious and had lots of flavour. Presentation was pretty and at the end we ordered enough to feel full though not without a price. 

Overall, the food was delicious, the service was good but price for the amount of food was just a bit too much for myself. They are other options out there for upscale Chinese food that might possibly be less expensive and closer to my neck of the woods.",1
600,"No wonder this place is so busy almost everyday,every hour, every season. Good service, good food & reasonable pricing ( for downtown core location).

The bad? The wait time. But I hit the jackpot tonight, without much wait time. 

Too loud for a decent conversation. If you want a full on conversation and not wanting to scream on top of your lungs,t with your louder than usual voice. Then this is not the place for you.",2
758,"Queen West small Italian shop with simple black and white décor, sizeable patio but limited seating inside, typical (you'll get the joke soon) Italian fair with a slight focus on risottos and pastas.

I thought just the décor was black and white, but it turned out the placemats and menus were also black and white - there's a collection of black ink art that reminds me of medieval times when artists worked for months on a simple line drawing to get things just right - whether it was embellishment in a single capital letter, or a decorative flower, or the skull of an animal - because you know, all these are completely related and belong side by side. Nothing wrong with it at all, it was definitely unique and presented artfully. 

The menu is deceptively lengthy - dishes are in Italian then described in English. I've never read a menu that uses ""typical"" as it's adjective of choice so much. Most of my party went for pastas - they were smaller portions than desired. It would've been fine as a lunch portion, but for dinner it was insufficient and taste was simpler than expected (or should I say, typical?). The risotto with veal was actually a highlight despite some other reviews and the portion was actually filling, unlike the gnocchi and ravioli items (those were the smallest!). Overall it was really not bad - but unfortunately underwhelming.

Service is very slow if you're a large group - so please spare them and only come with a few friends. You'll enjoy the ambiance more and sharing more items will be more feasible, and your overall experience will just be that much better! If I'm in the area I suppose I could give it another shot, but for one that values taste over aesthetic, I might not be back.",1
51,"TLDR: Fantastic staff and service, good homey atmosphere and some of the best Mexican I've had in Toronto.

I came here after work one day for dinner. Upon walking in the menu is on a giant poster to your right and it lists out a couple options (no more than 20) and you order and pay at the counter before getting served. As soon as I walked in one of the staff immediately greeted me and welcomed me to the restaurant. I don't usually comment on service, but the service I revived from multiple staff at Como En Casa was absolutely amazing and therefore noteworthy.

I got the enchiladas ($13), which came with rice and beans as well. The chicken enchiladas came in threes with the mole sauce surrounding it, a white sauce drizzled on top of it and some lettuce and a type of cheese stacked on top if it as well. The chicken inside was very soft and overall the enchiladas were delicious. The mole added a nice kick to it as well. The rice was well-seasoned and very tasty and I could've easily downed a couple more servings of it. I'm not usually a bean guy, but the beans were prepared very well here as well. They were mashed to a thick-ish consistency and the taste of the beans was not overwhelming, which I usually find at other restaurants. The meal also came with a homemade mild-hot sauce which was also very good. I think my only complaint is that the portions could've been a bit larger (at least for the rice and beans, which are pretty cheap). However, the meal was good enough to make it worth the price anyways. 

I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.",2
1645,"Great place for affordable comfort Chinese food! Might get a bit packed though.

We've ordered green beans, noodles, and a bunch of stuff (I don't remember quite frankly) but the food was quick, fresh, and hot! 

Will definitely  come back :)",2
843,"High hope bc of high rating from all the other yelpers. We ordered a special seafood spaghetti and lamb chop.  Why is it special seafood spaghetti?  It is because it included half lobster and crab legs tonight in the spaghetti!  Honestly, there are lots of seafood in the plate, but I would prefer more tomato sauce.  On the other hand, the lamb chop is very good!  Lamb meat is very tender.  At the end of the dinner, the restaurant provide free dessert, which is very nice!",2
697,"Oh yes padre. I have been salivating over this place for for quite some time now and when I was able to finally visit I was glad to see I wasn't disappointed!

My friend and I went on a Friday night at 5pm and to our delight there was no line up! Their dining area is very small and they don't do reservations. It's decorated with red and white table linens and there's a simple chalk menu board above where the cashier is. This area is for takeout orders. We sat down and our waitress came by to give us some advice about her favs which helped.

We got mozzarella sticks to start which was served with their signature sugo. They were super tasty. We also got a caesar salad. It was very fresh and super garlicky, just the way I like it! My friend got the gnocchi that came with their signature sugo (sauce) and I got chicken parmigiana with spaghetti in sugo. They gave me 2 pieces of chicken, and the mountain of spaghetti was HUGE. I seriously had leftovers for 2 meals after that. 

The chicken parmigiana was magnificent, tender and flavourful. The spaghetti was cooked perfectly and sauce was deliziosa. I had some of my friend's gnocchi too and wish I got too because it was so tasty, light and fluffy little pillows of gnocchi heaven.

We got tiramisu afterwards to share for dessert. Honestly at this point I was surprised we were able to have anything else. The tiramisu was so good. A good portion and it was one of the best tiramisus I've ever had!

Can't wait to come back here for the other dishes!",2
1565,"Cheap and delicious, two of my favourite words, accurately describe GB Hand-Pulled Noodles.

As is typically the case, places like this come with its sacrifices. For starters, there was a line out the door when I strolled in one Saturday for lunch with friends. 

We were eventually seated, though I found the tables quite packed together - they really maximized the space....to the detriment of comfort. 

The food makes up for it - I tried the thick beef noodles and they were some of the best I've had. Plus, you can even see your noodles getting pulled and freshly cooked.

But, before you're even finished your delicious bowl, you'll find waiters beginning to clean your table and dropping you the bill - you'll definitely feel rushed when eating here.",1
1514,"Oh my God!! How did they get high ratings!!????? They had sectional sittings and some open areas. The place is dark for a Chinese restaurant. The decor is mostly wooden plaques and wood carvings. 

The servers or staff there were not friendly and talked behind your back. Yes, I understand Mandarin even though I spoke English to them!! I had to get up twice to get their attention and they only had three tables with customers. 

It's supposed to be fine dining so I had a feeling that the portion would be smaller. Ok. But why all the saltiness in your dishes!!! The veggie dish was pricey and decent. The shrimp fried rice lacked the shrimps. They were tiny!! The rice was hard. It felt more of a Caucasian dish. The beef and broccoli dish was the largest dish full of salt!! Basically eat and drink lots of water. 

I was obviously not satisfied or full. Dishes were TOO SALTY, even my friend didn't like them. 

Never will I go back!",0
1858,"Another month has come and gone and here we are in the heart of Toronto just doing our thing. We've walked by Artisan Plus many time and we finally gave it a try. This place was buzzing with people around the lunch hour however the wait for a table for two wasn't very long. We waited may be 5 mins.

As this was our first visit we wanted to try a few of the appetizers and different noodles dishes. As such for the apps, we ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo which is handcraft artisan bread with chopped braised pork belly and gravy. The braised pork belly was quite tasty however it did get quite messy because of the gravy. We also tried the Shuan Tofu Sheet which was made of fresh tofu sheet mixed with bean sprouts, shredded red pepper, scallion, gourmet chilli, peanut and sesame sauce. This dish had the very slightest numbing spice. However this dish was slightly on the oily side and the tofu sheet were too long.

For our mains, I tried the Famous Yo Po Biang Mian which was ribbon noodle, sauteed tomato, scramble egg, cauliflower, potato, carrot, organic cloud ear mushroom, edamame, grilled zucchini, paparika, and vinegrette. The ribbon noodle was super long which made eating the noodle slightly difficult. However the flavours were different and interesting. Nothing that really made my taste buds dance. There was no numbing spice to this dish. However if you don't eat spicy on a regular basis I wouldn't recommend this dish. My husband tried the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. Surprisingly the Lamb wasn't super gamey. Again the noodles were all super long and the flavour was okay. However, I still want to try their noodle soup one day. 

The service was on the ball. The waitress was always around in case you needed them. Than again the restaurant wasn't super large. There were probably around 40 seats.",1

staff great 
food fresh and hot .....lots of fun and it doesn't break the bank!!",2
307,"Every now and then I have a food craze and lately it's been for Mexican food  I love everything about this place , from the ambience to the food presentation and taste. On Sundays they have bottomless tacos which is what I had along with a passion fruit frozen margarita  I will definitely be back! $$ ~",2
1766,"I have been here in three years and the quality has definitely come down.

We ordered the chicken fried rice which had no carrots or peas just rice and chicken. It tasted ok.

The sesame chicken was way too sweet and tasted like a chicken Tim bit.

The dim sum was below average for the price. There are definitely better and cheaper options. I a long time customer will not be returning.",0
1116,"Atmosphere in this restaurant was nice food was delicious but I can't tell you how cheap they are on their drinks
Tall skinny Glass half filled with ice maybe a quarter of a can of pop/coke you're getting $2.30 per serving it left such a bad taste in my mouth I felt ripped off really think about it your customers are paying $23 for a plate of pasta and you can't provide them a full can or a decent portion of your fountain drink really really cheap and I've never seen anything like it in all of my travels so for that is why I'm leaving a three star",1
255,Ordered through Ritual. Nice atmosphere. Order  ready on time. Chicken Tinga tacos had ggood flavour our. Maybe a bit on the small side but overall good value,2
505,"Quetzal is interesting. There's this big huge space that goes for miles with a glimpse into kitchen. At the front, there's a huge table with natural light, and the bar is impeccably stocked and gorgeous. We sat at the bar, and it was fun conversing with our server who was full of quips and stories. His drinks were equally interesting. 

The food though, for Mexican just wasn't as great as the rest of the restaurant itself. Things were plated prettily (maybe a bit oddly), but nothing popped our taste buds as Mexican flavours should. It was just an okay meal. We left a bit hungry and wanting more.",1
800,"First time trying their new location, and see if they can keep up their best quality of food and services. Carisma never disappointed me. Upon arrival, I notice the environment is much nicer and more elegant than their old location, as well as their wide open kitchen. We ordered scallop with foie gras, and squid with tomato salsa. Both are delicious, but the scallop is memorable. For main courses, we had the tiger shrimp tomato sauce pasta, and mix seafood in tomato soup. The tiger shrimps are so huge, never seen such a huge size in dining for a long time. For dessert, cream burlee is a must, a small shareable size to finish off the meal. Carisma is definitely a well known high quality Italian fine dining in the downtown Toronto area, and already start my planning to go again for dinner!",2
1800,"[FOOD] - 3.5/5
I was highly anticipating my lunch here since I rarely find authentic Xian restaurants (Northwestern Chinese cuisine) in Toronto. I ordered Xian dishes such as the Steamed Lamb Pita Soup, the Chinese burger (Stuffed Pita), and the Northwestern Cold Noodles. My favourite item was the pita soup. The broth was just rich and flavourful... it would go great on a cold winter day. The cold noodles were a super refreshing part of the meal. Lastly, the Chinese burger (with lamb filling) was pretty good as well. The outer bun was crispy, not too thick, and quite delicious. 

[SERVICE] - 4/5
Okay, so I only gave 4/5 because my boyfriend speaks Chinese and the lady also speaks Chinese. She was quite nice and accommodating. It would've been nice if they had more than one server and spoke English. My boyfriend had to translate for the table of 14 next to us who could hardly understand the server. 

[OVERALL] - 3/5
While the restaurant can seem demeaning and unfriendly to non-Chinese speakers, it is a great place to go for highly authentic Xian cuisine.",1
1481,"CASH only. There's a bunch of banks/ATMS around the area so you're good just in case. Service is less to be desired but the dumplings were pretty solid. If it's your first time, I recommend trying 3 different flavours first for $12-13 (additional $2) instead of committing 12 dumplings to one flavour. They've got steamed and pan-fried. We really like the pork and shrimp - the only juicy and flavourful dumpling. The classic pork and chive were quite dry and the spinach needed salt to save its integrity. Tried their beef noodles and was super garlicky and the noodles were broken up which was annoying to eat.

Overall, will I be back, probably not - considering there are so many other dumpling spots in the area that will probably have better dumplings and better service.",1
1400,"The food here is amazing. I understand why previous reviews mentioned it being an OG spot and authentic taste overall. They specialized in more FuZhou cooking but it's good cause it doesn't have the oily and greasy taste afterwards. We enjoyed everything we ordered and the portions were a great size for what we needed that day. They cook really good snow pea leaves, probably one of the best I've had in Chinese restaurants. So definitely no complaints about the food at all, it's totally worth it but CASH ONLY! 

The only reason why I'm giving it a 3 is because they don't have the best table service (which seemed to be the case in the Toronto Chinatown area). The waiting staff look really annoyed at you and the lack of hospitality is not what I'm used to when I go to restaurants. Maybe the workers are being overworked and not compensated enough, just don't let it rub you the wrong way if you want to try the food, it does come out fast and I did really enjoy it.",1
1380,"Mmmmmmmm no place better to have a steak in Toronto.

I came here for a celebratory dinner and we were put into the private room next to the wine cellar. It was very secluded, quiet and good for bigger groups.

When you're at Jacob's, it's mandatory that you get their Caesar Salad - it's unlike any Caesar salad you've ever had. Nonetheless, the spotlight is on the steaks. I didn't know the differences between them so I had the server help me out. I wasn't disappointed because we ordered 4 different steaks and I could taste the difference in each.

What an extraordinary experience to a carnivorous meal.",2
1765,"I went for an early dinner and there was one other couple in the restaurant. It slowly picked up with large and noisey families. The good was good. Wontons were a bit greasy but fresh. Dumplings were great. Hate asking for red wine vinegar when I visit dim sum restaurants, as I did here, just leave a bottle on the table next to the soy sauce. Sticky rice was hot but lacked much flavour. No refills on soft drinks. Host was great, server was OK. Nicely decorated room",1
1458,"Overall a good experience at Lee Chen. We were heading to the theatre and decided to drop by for dinner. There was still lots of tables available at 6pm on a Wednesday. 

We went for the Shanghai Noodles, pork dumplings, chicken fried rice and Wuxi spare ribs. Everything was tasty and exactly what we expected. A lot of times, the food would not come out as pictured, but this was not the case. 

Overall a solid Asian restaurant considering it is located in an area that isn't known for the Asian food. Service was swift and the restaurant was roomy. Felt like we were eating in Markham vs. Downtown Toronto.",2
14,"Playa Cabana is about a 15 minute walk from my office and I hadn't planned on going there but the person I had an appointment with nearby wasn't available so I decided to have lunch first.

Walking in, it's a very narrow, small space, almost claustraphobic. The dim lighting didn't help but it set an intimate mood for the place. This looks like a nice neighbourhood watering hole and the immediate neighbourhood is mostly residential.

I ordered the Tostadas with beef and it was served on a crispy tortilla, topped with lettuce, guacamole, black beans, and a few other ingredients.

The presentation was nice and the taste was even nicer! With layers of ingredients, every bite revealed a different flavour and texture and they all worked well together. Delicious!

There were four different sauces on the table, with varying degrees of heat. I tried them all and they were all good.

I may just have to make this walk more often.",2
1879,"Dinner:
Peking Duck, 2 courses
Spicy Shrimp hot pot with vermicelli
Shrimp with black bean sauce

I had not been to Lai Wah Heen in several years, until recently.

The two course peking duck was definitely better than in a normal restaurant. I could tell that the flour wraps were of much higher quality than normal. Perhaps made fresh at the restaurant? 
They serve it with the duck, cucumber, green onion already on the wrap, then you can add the sauce on your own.
The second course was a pretty standard version of the lettuce wraps.

Spicy Shrimp Hot Pot with Vermicelli was excellent. I would order this dish again without question. The clear vermicelli noodles are a great compliment to the spicy sauce and large shrimp.

Shrimp with black bean sauce was good, but did not stick out as much.

Overall, it was a good meal, but the prices are prohibitive.",1
140,"We went here on a pretty, hot and sunny day so we opted to get seated outside. This cute Mexican cuisine place is so adorable. Their prices for food are fair and come in nice portions, their customer service is also very excellent, our server was so sweet.

The nachos were very good! The salsa was very flavourful and tasted really bright, totally recommend",2
1856,"Tight seating area with not much space between tables, nor to put winter parkas. My friend's seat was more like a plastic stool. Not comfy at all. More of a eat and run place but your tummy might be hungry still. 

The service was good. We got three water refills from the bottle as it was small. 

My dish came out messy and the portion for $14 was small. There aren't enough veggies. The spicy taste was a good quick to it. The noodle looked like gnocchi and it was chewy. My friend's dish came later on as they messed up the order. She said it was ok. Again, one is paying the price for a small portion of food that wouldn't fill up one's stomach 

So definitely I was still hungry before heading to the theatre. 

Verdict- not sure where they are getting the high reviews but it's not worth my time. For $14 plus taxes and tips, I'll rather eat at a food court that would satisfy this Cat-Squirrel's tummy. Bring on the food!!",0
1517,"This is my favorite Chinese place for spicy northern food since Anne's Magic Kitchen mysteriously shuttered. I recommend visiting with someone who can read Chinese as the Chinese menu options are more extensive (sorry anglophones, you get a concise and diluted white-adapted menu)

I recommend these dishes: 夫婦肺片（a Szechuan style cold appetizer of sliced lung and tripe with sliced beef, drizzled in chili oil), 口水雞(if you've had drunken chicken, this is like a hot, super spicy and scintillating version of that) , 牛肉手抓餅（an elastic yet flaky Chinese pastry, kind of like paratha is shaped like a tortilla and either rolled up with layers of beef or another meat and served burrito style or sandwich style). Those are some to start with. Of course if you're feeling adventurous you can always just point to the next table who probably would have a hot pan with fish or meats in it, bubbling with chilis, scallions and sesame oil and try a lovely spicy northern Chinese stew. 

The first time I came here it was packed with young (and well off) Asians wearing high fashion streetwear and kpop haircuts. We got a table for 2 in 5 minutes and orders seemed to lag a bit and it was hard to flag down the server. But the food is indelibly savoury and makes up for the disorganized service.",2
477,"we ordered the seven course tasting menu for two, and it was so much food that I'd say I had a solid second trimester food baby: 
-Pepita adobo dip. A nice change of pace from Guacamole and chips
-tuna ceviche
-quinoa queso fresco salad
-handmade tortillas with fresh with and cabbage
-carne Assad's corn tacos
-braised beef with mole
-churros

And a watermelon margarita- delicious!",2
48,"This is one of my favourite little spots to hit up in core downtown Toronto when I'm just looking for something quick to eat. 

The restaurant is small, crowded in feel, so get close to you next table neighbour. The cashier and perhaps owner or family member of the owner, like to point out the picture version of the menu to the right of the door as you enter. Portions sizes are large enough to give you your fill for lunch. 

I got the fish tacos. Well fried with a well seasons fish, which is sweet and moist. There is like a coleslaw that tops it along with pickled onion slices. All of this along with hot sauces creates this lovely mix of salty, umami, sweet, sour, and spicy. What a delight. This is all held together by two 6"" corn tortilla, which in my opinion is a little small for the size of the fish. 

The Jamaica is made from hibiscus and is sweet, earthy, and tart and is a lovely refreshing beverage for nice summer day. 

The one critique is the price but I mean prices are just generally higher everywhere no a days. But the price combined with the small space that forces intimacy between strangers keep this space from being a full 5 stars. The food and the service make this place a 4.5 star location for me.",2
145,Had a delicious breakfast in the sun with a great waitress and her cutest little helper. The breakfast along with some beef tongue tacos were amazing.,2
1865,"I have been here twice already after they opened, first time didn't impress me that much, I ordered the spicy biangbiang noodle with pork belly and the pork belly jiamo, they also have spicy oil on the side of u don't think it's spicy enough just ask them to give u the jar. The biangbiang noodle has too much vegetable in it(XD which isn't bad, but I would be much happier if there r more pork), instead of the pork belly which they were claiming on the menu, I think it's more like pulled pork texture, so if u don't like pulled pork texture, go for the beef option. The jiamo is like a bun with lots of meat inside, it's it's very filling I can't even finish it. 

Second time here, the line up is equally long, we had 5 people and they are too tiny to fit us, we had to squeeze and it wasn't comfortable. I ordered the clam mashi noodle which is like a Chinese style gnocchi , ITS SOOOOOOOOO GOOOOOOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have never had mashi like this and I'm really impressed!!! I will definitely come back for more of this!!!!!!!!",2
1799,"I am a huge fan of Xian style Biang Biang Mein. I haven't found a place in Toronto that makes this. Therefore, when I found a picture of this dish on their ad outside I had to try it. It is strange that I could not find a yelp review. However, there were plenty of google reviews on this restaurant.

It's own by a couple and I feel they gear their restaurant to Chinese speaking customers. Their English is quite weak. I ordered the Biang Biang noodles and steam dumplings. I wrote the number down and wrote the English name on the paper. The lady had to clarify what I meant with another customer. They make their dumplings from scratch and have a pretty big menu.

I do have to admit their Biang Biang noodles and their dumplings are not the best I had. However, they are cheaper than other places around Spadina. What I did not enjoy was one of the owner/cook was clearing his throat alot during the time I was there which was very gross because you hope he did not spit on your food. Really, clearing your throat should be done in the privacy of your own home and not your business where they are customers.

The owners are nice but they are more friendly to Chinese speaking customers because they can communicate with them. If you cannot speak Chinese they will serve you but you will be ignored most of the time.",1
10,"I was skeptical of this place at first as it look like I'm walking into a duplex, but man was I wrong. I should know that hole in the walls are the best kind. The service probably could have been better which is why the 4 and not the 5. 

The chips are amazing, freshly made, hot and the perfect amount of salt. The salsa you could tell was just made and that it all came straight from the garden. 

My favorite was the short rib taqueria. The short ribs alone I could have eaten bowls of it, full of flavor and so tender. 

The carnitas tacos were also tender but my favorite was the crispy skin, so crunchy and probably oh so bad for me.

The fish tacos were really good too, nice and flaky.",2
1455,"Came here for team lunch for CNY. Oh man. This place is packed! When we got to the reception desk, the group in front of us did not have a reservation. They were turned away. Glad we did book the day before. 

Anyhow, Chinese food option in the financial district can be rare. And when my colleagues proposed  this place. I was thinking, let's give this a try. 

We got here and were led to our table. After we sat down, I saw the other tables were filled up in 15 mins. Talk about busy. One good thing is they got a lot of staff roaming around to deliver food. Yet, they were super busy regardless. 

We ordered our food and I went with the business lunch with meatball. The food did come out shortly after. The sauce for the meatball isn't super salty. Which I prefer. It has the right texture for the meatball. Other stuff tasted okay. It ain't bad overall, I wasn't wowed by the food.",1
1869,"The food here was mediocre but the service was absolutely abysmal, to the point where I'm not even considering the food in the rating I'm giving. 

The server was extremely rude - I asked for an iced tea (canned drink) upon being seated after a 20 minute wait and the server legit said ""just order your drink when you order everything else"" and walked away, even though it was simply a canned drink that takes 1 minute to take out of the fridge. 

When it came time to order our meal, I asked for the drink again, which the server acknowledged. I didn't receive the drink during my whole meal and no one came to check on us so I wasn't able to reorder. 

When the bill came, they actually had the audacity to charge us for the drink that I never received, and when we asked them to take it off the bill they didn't come back with the bill for over 15 minutes, and didn't print a receipt for us because their ""machine was broken"". 

Honestly I'm not sure if we were charged for it, but a place that would allow their servers to talk to/treat customers like this is definitely not a place that I would recommend to others because it says a lot about the restaurant's values and culture, and the food is definitely not special enough to put up with this kind of service.",0
825,"Absolutely terrible food and even worse attitude and service. 

Didn't even have a bite of the food",0
1408,"If you haven't heard of Swatow or haven't been yet you totally should. While not totally vegan this is another location in Toronto where you can get some Chinese style food that is vegan. The portions are huge and it's very inexpensive for what you get and it will not disappoint your taste buds.

Be prepared to wait a bit to get in. This is a very small place and can be very busy especially during standard meal hours. The staff were friendly and super accommodating to us. They mainly have small tables but there are a few bigger ones. If you have a fairly large group of say more than 5 people you might want to reconsider if you all want to eat at once and sit together. This is great for small groups or even the solo diner. It was actually so busy when we went that we wound up sitting at a bigger table with other diners which was a lot of fun actually. 

No matter the shortcomings of this establishment once you try the food it will all melt away and you'll actually wonder if it even matters. Just go I doubt it you'll walk away without wanting to come back.",2
1122,"It's ok. It's definitely not 4.5 lol. 

We got the prosciutto and ricotta fritters to start and those were great. Took a little too long to come out but they were redeeming. 

We got the oreciette (sp?) and duck tagliatelle and both fell short in different areas. The duck tagliatelle was definitely missing some flavour notes - probably lacking in aromatics- maybe garlic? Something was missing. The pasta was also way overdone for a restaurant and not al dente at all. It needed a lot more salt- and even though I got piles of parmesan on it, it was still under salted. 

The oreciette to me was the better of the two- the pasta was perfectly al dente and the chilli component made the taste better, but it was still missing something- hard to say what.

The tables adjacent to us seemed to really like their food so maybe it was just us.

We didn't get dessert so I can't speak for that. 

I would maybe come back and try to gnocchi but other than that, nothing really sparked my interest.",1
1807,"We picked this restaurant without checking Yelp. Given the current rating, we wouldn't have come in. We are pleasantly surprised by their handmade boiled dumplings (pork and chives filling and pork and fennel filling). Both are tasty and authentic. We also have three other dishes. All good.",2
762,"Hovering between 3 and 4 stars. The food was delicious to be sure, but the price point was extremely high for the portions we received. I realized the pasta is made in house so that accounts for a lot of it, but it still just felt pretty pricey given we didn't really order that much and got pretty hungry again a few hours later.

My husband ordered the ravioli (8 small ravioli in dish. It was FANTASTIC but a tiny portion) and I had the mushroom tagliatelle (also great but just mushrooms tossed in a light sauce with a bit of parsley). We also split the chocolate cake for dessert and I had a glass of wine and the whole tab came out to around $70. WHAT. The night before we ate at another restaurant with dishes packed with seafood, veggies, meat, and more and we spent the same amount of money for around 8-9 small plates of food. And everything was made from scratch there as well. 

The experience was nice, and the food was good but I would probably not return given you can get more for your money in Toronto at other locations and have an equally delicious meal.",1
258,"Cool decor, nice location, funky music and great service by everyone I interacted with. 

They have a selection of Mexican beer available as well. What better way to have a taco and a beer in hand? 

I ordered the pork burrito bowl, lots to fill you up. It tasted quite good. But nothing to wow me to come back to try it again. The spice level I ordered was medium. I think it's a bit lighter than you think with the spice level. 

My friend ordered the mix of tacos trying 3 different types. He claims the beef was by far the best one. 

I did enjoy the spread of hot sauces available to use on top of your ordered spice level.",1
768,"I really have mixed feelings about this restaurant. I dined here for dinner and tried quite good amount of food from appetizer to pastas. I feel like this place is better for lunch as portions are small and the vibe and lighting in the restaurant was too light for me for an evening dinner. I loved the black and white simple decor, however I would definitely recommend having less light towards evening. 

As for the drink, I tried the Pinot Grigio, and I loved it. If you like an easy white wine with notes of sweetness, this would be perfect.

For appetizer, we ordered a cheese and cold cut board. I was not impressed with the selection of cheeses there. There were two types of cheese and two types of cold cuts. Both cheeses tasted very bland and simple. The portion was fairly good though and it came with a honey and house-made jam which was a nice garnish to it. We also got the meatball to share by the server's recommendation. Probably this was my least favorite item. It was different from a usual Italian meatball you imagine, maybe it is the Milanese way. However I did not like it and it was too dry and meaty. We asked for a side tomato sauce so we can dip them in it.

For main, we ordered two different pasta dishes, the Tagliatelle al funghi porcini and Casoncelli alla bergamasca. They make the pastas fresh in house which I think is what makes this restaurant special. The funghi pasta tasted really good and I loved the mushrooms in it, however I felt it was lacking sauce. Casoncelli alla bergamasca was a meat ravioli with some butter sauce on it, however there was just a little butter sauce on it and it tasted very basic to me. I would say both pastas had very small amount of sauce and both tasted very simple.",1
1764,"Pricey but good dimsum. Less fatty and greasy than traditional. Good service. The meals looked good, but I only tried the dimsum",2
614,"Came here on a Sunday evening with 4 people. The seafood risotto was good with lots of seafood. 

The surprising part was that the server/restaurant added automatically added a 20% tip to the bill. He just put in the tip amount himself on the POS terminal and said service charge was added. 

I do not like being forced into tipping at a certain amount and therefore would not visit the restaurant again.",0
70,"This place has been bookmarked for awhile and I finally had the chance to try out this local restaurant located in Scarborough. This is a takeout and dine in restaurant - very casual.

After ordering at the counter, they offer complimentary chips and salsa. The salsa was so thin and watered down - no flavour whatsoever. I would have rather opted to not have it at all. 

I ordered the Chorizo Quesadilla which comes with beans, rice and salad. There are two sauces on dish but both were bland and lacking any taste. My sister ordered the Chicken Burrito which comes with the same sides, again it was bland and quite disappointing. I'm flabbergasted as to how this place has 4/5 stars when there are other places that taste so much better. Maybe it was an off day but this is not my first time having Mexican food. 

Sure the price is on point and portion is decent but quality and taste needs improvement. 

I'm sorry but I will not be returning.",0
1586,"I've been here once before and had a good experience. The pickled cabbage beef soup was plentiful for two people and we had enough to EACH take home for a second meal. Everything was delicious and I craved it everyday until I went again. 

The second time, there was barely anything in the soup and they forgot the pickled cabbage...the pickled cabbage that's in the name! I brought it to a waiter's attention and she had the audacity to just bring it out in a bowl, did not offer for the kitchen to add it to the soup and recook it. Very disappointed. At checkout they did offer 10% off without me having to do anything, which was nice. But still. How do you forget one of main ingredients?!",1
715,"A very popular Italian restaurant, but didn't quite live up to the hype.

We came on a hot summer day and it was very crowded. We ended up getting a seat upstairs outside on the balcony, but it was very crowded--both in terms of people and seating space.
The seats were pretty minuscule and packed together. There was barely enough space for us to squeeze between the tables to sit down on the outer seats--despite being on the thinner side myself. My other friends, who chose to sit on the inner side, would definitely not be able to squeeze into the outer seats because they are tall men who also hit the gym--their extra pound of muscles already cut them from sitting here, so I can only imagine the types of people who are regular patrons. 

We got the calamaratato con gamberi, mafalde al funghi, rigatoni bologanese, and risotto nervosa.
The server recommended the calamaratato con gamberi since it was a popular dish with some spiciness, but it was quite lackluster. The dish wasn't spicy at all, granted we're quite accustomed to spicy foods. 
The mafalde al funghi was delicious and creamy with a full bodied flavour. 
The rigatoni bologanese was a very typical pasta that tasted like a deconstructed lasagna--which isn't a bad thing. It felt too commonplace and lackluster for this price point though.
The risotto nervosa was probably the star of the show. The risotto is amazing and creamy and the braised beef pairs well with it. Though I will admit that the beef, when eaten on its own, felt a little dry. 

Perhaps it's because I'm more accustomed to Asian food, but this restaurant felt quite underwhelming and overpriced.
Many of the dishes didn't stand out too much and is quite comparable to what you would find at much lower price points or even store bought. Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but perhaps not worthy of a second visit.",1
1102,"Super average food with inflated prices. It's a small place so you have to make reservations even on a week night. 
The veggie pasta that I got (linguine with cream sauce and mushrooms) costed me 20 bucks without tax. The pasta was al dente which I liked but lacked much flavour. The portion size on the other hand was big. 
The calamari was also around $20 but was well cooked. I just wish we got more pieces :( They charred it nicely but by the time it made it to our table it was cold. 
The sever talked super fast but was friendly and happy. Not sure if I will return because I wasn't impressed with anything!",1
150,"2.5 stars but rounds up to 3. Okay tacos but nothing special. Al pastor was dry and lacked flavor.  Service was friendly and very quick (tacos came in less than 3 minutes after ordering).  Frozen margs we're good, though. 

Tinga Tacos: 3/5
Al Pastor Tacos: 2/5
Mango Margarita: 4/5",1
946,"Tasty food, but a bit of a disappointment.

I booked a big party for my brother's birthday people. They were incredible about this, they kept in communication with me and were actually able to accommodate 26 adults and 6 babies with a week's notice, which grew to 32 adults, then shrunk back to 26 once we got there. Flakiness. 

We all had the $34 prix fixe, which meant three apps and three pastas shared family style and an individual entree dish. I was sitting at a table with 11 other people, and we didn't get enough food. Each of the sharing dishes was a dinner plate size, shared across all 12 of us, leaving everyone with literally 2 soup spoons full of each item. This was a huge surprise to me as I've eaten at the Danforth location with the same sort of setup - big party, shared plates, except we had the same size of dish for 4 people. 

The other tables in our party (table of maybe 8 adults and 4 kids, and another table with 5 adults and two kids) got the same amount of food, and they were pretty stuffed. We ended up asking for a second portion of the pasta, because it really was a very small amount of food per person, especially considering the price of the meal. The server balked at this, but gave us another serving, which was devoured in a second. 

The food itself was very good (though the osso buco was a bit bland), and for the most part, the service was great, but unfortunately the dinner ended with a table of adults who were still hungry.",0
623,"Top 3 Italian in the city.  

Nice atmosphere. Valet parking. Great service. Very tasty Italian with gluten free options. 

Ask for the house made fresh stuffed  pasta.  

My date and I had an amazing stuffed pasta that was off the menu.  This was one of the best pasta dishes I've had in the city. 

The lamb melts in your mouth.  They lay the fish out for display which is great for assessing freshness.",2
109,"My top tacos place in Toronto now!  After having some killer authentic tacos in Chicago I've been lamenting my inability to find the same flavor closer to home. Hacienda las Americas has now saved the day!

You know that the food is gonna be good when you are served water in a Tequila bottle and even better that the fish tacos were on special that night! We got baja fish, al pastor, carnitas and beef tacos. Each was absolutely delicious and bursting with flavor. Basically you can do no wrong whatever you choose.

We warned that the place isn't fancy or upscale, more a local tacos joint that the neighborhood seems to hang out at. At one point some water started dripping onto our table from above. We weren't even phased, just switched tables and kept eating (they were that good).",2
432,First time here and I loved everything we ordered. The food was authentic and very flavourful. Each dish had its own unique flavours. It's a great Mexican spot in the beaches.,2
644,"Service was horrible. I cant explain with the words. We waited a lot for everything. The bill came 15 minute after I asked. Pasta was extremley small but i cant understand this shit. Why dont you put more pastocon the plate ? Pasta is super cheap thing also there is no cheaper pasta than $22. Like just put some more that than i can say it worth! 

Terrible experience I dont reccomend to people go there.",0
1859,"So much hype we had to stop by and try it out. This place is newish to me located near Dundas and Bay and I've seen it being renovated months ago and thought the interior was really hip and modern looking. This is a noodle place that serves Northern Chinese style, the menu is very simple and don't have too many different things clouding your mind on what to eat. 

We ordered the Artisan Pork Jia Mo, and Shuan Tofu Sheet for starters. The pork Jia Mo is chopped braised pork belly with gravy served in a handcrafted artisan bread, this was not bad but flavour was slightly weak in my opinion. The tofu sheets are made from fresh sheets, this dish is served cold and almost like a salad with shredded peppers, bean sprouts, scallions, chilli, chilli oil, Sichuan pepper corns, and sesame oil. I found that the flavour is good not too much numbing spice and not too spicy but boy it did have tons of oil. 

For mains we ordered their Famous YoPo Biang Mian and the Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb. the Biang mian has a lot going on with sauteed tomato, scrambled eggs, cauliflower, potato, carrot, woodear mushrooms, zucchini, edamame beans, paprika, and vinaigrette sitting under all these ingredients are some ribbon noodles which were slightly too long. I thought that this dish was a mixed with way too many things and the flavour got lost way too busy. The Wok Cumin Che Mian with Spring Lamb was better and the lamb wasn't gamy but I wish there was more slices of lamb. This dish I found was a little small for the price. 

Service was great our server was very knowledgeable about their product. She kept our water carafe topped with water. The food comes out very quick and displayed nicely. When it came time to pay the bill was ready and the server came with a debit machine as well. Be prepared to bring cash with you as this place is cash or debit only.

I will be back to try some soup noodles next time. Hopefully it will change my mind and get a better rating.",1
972,"Wow. Fucking amazing pasta. You can really taste the quality of the ingrédients... it's insane how good it was. 

If you're coming here, come early as the line can grow to at least an hour. There are maybe 5 or 6 tables, so not a whole lot of room. 

I'm waiting to order while watching people make and design the fresh pasta, it is beyond cool. The menu is always changing and I will be back. 

The freshest pasta I've ever had, and again everything was so simple and fresh but so delicious. 

Keep Eating, 
Angela",2
1190,"Had my bday dinner at the counter seating in front of the kitchen, a great spot to watch the chef cooking the dishes. Food was great except the pasta. It's raw, not Al dente. We ordered the octopus. The portion size of each piece has a quite big difference. Wonder if they give s bigger portion for a large table. As we only had two people, we ordered the pork chop instead of the porterhouse. It's lovely cooked with cheeky pink inside. The highlight was the dessert, pine nut tart with wildflower honey and vanilla mascarpone. It's not too sweet with balanced flavour. 
The kitchen gave us a piece of choco tarte as bday cake. It's funny that the candle light was off three times as it's windy above our seats. 
I'd love to try their pizza in the future. However I doubt if I will go again coz they don't seem like to chat with asians",1
962,"This place is 4.5 stars. I only wish they open more days and longer hours. Definitely hidden gem of the city; they only served lunch from Tuesday to Friday, noon to 2pm or till sold out. Not good for big group, 10-seat only. Highly recommend to get there early if you plan to dine in since line has been formed as early as 11:30am. If you cannot get first 10 seats, you can order and leave your number with them and they will call you when a table is available. 

Upon entered the space, you can smell nice aroma like you are coming home with delicious home-cook food. Limited daily menu is written on the Blackboard or pay attend to their daily Instagram story. Everything is very reasonable priced; actually I should say is a steal!!

During our visit, we tried Tagliolini (egg noodles with butter, rosemary and porcini mushrooms), Cappellacci Verdi (green duck filled with butter and duck braise), Fior di Latte, Crudo (San Daniele D.O.P. 24 month). 

I love every single dish; they gave a very clean and simple taste like home made food. My favourite is Tagliolini; the egg noodle is so bouncy, al dente with nice eggy taste. The mushroom is so aromatic and fresh. Fior di Latte and Crudo are very tasty and flavourful. Cappellacci is very nice with very rich duck flavour. 

I wish to come here more often!! Love this place very much!!",2
1111,"Excellent Italian taste , try the bruschetta for starters and the Zupe de mare dish see photo for main dish , end it with the red velvet tasty cake .",2
1862,"Overall, an OK noodle spot. Interesting to try out but not a must-try. 

I ordered the Famous YoPo Biang Biang Mian (which the waitress mentioned was their most popular dish) and the Shuan Tofu Sheets:

Biang Biang Mian: The plate is quite large so if you're hungry this is the dish to order. The noodles were pretty tasty/chewy and the beef tasted good but the rest of the plate didn't really stand out and was loaded with vegetables (see picture).

Shuan Tofu Sheets: Again, another OK dish but wasn't amazing. While the flavor is there from the peanut and sesame sauce, the texture of the tofu was off-putting after a few strands. We didn't finish the dish. 

If you're looking for spicy noodles, give this restaurant a try. Otherwise, tons more noodle places to eat around Yonge-Dundas.",1
487,"If you walk by too fast and you'll miss the store!  It is a very small shop with all sorts of Mexican delights!  It is located directly across from a major subway stop, Dufferin station.  We pre ordered Rosca de Reyes for the new year and it was amazing.  What they don't have at this location can be found in their larger store.   Well worth the stop",2
1705,"One of our go-to spots! 

For price, flavour and quantity of food - you can't go wrong. 

My favourite things in this place are the skewers. Just drooling while writing this haha. The lamb, beef and chicken options are heavennn! So much flavour. 

Always need veggies with my meals, so we order Chinese broccoli with garlic. I don't know what they do to the meal. Super simple but it's so crunchy and tasty.

Lastly, hand pulled noodles are a must. I usually go for the braised beef but this time around we got the sliced beef. I prefer braised! You get a good mix of fat to meat ratio.

Highly recommend this place. Just don't be high maintenance!",2
332,"This was the worst $32 I ever spent ... 
soggy & flavourless. Was very excited to try this place but I don't think I will be returning or ordering again in the future. Disappointed :(",0
1486,"This was my second time dining at this establishment, but mark my words it is the last! While eating an order of noodles I was splitting with my gf I came across a COCKROACH!!!!!  

When I confronted the owner he looked down at my plate and saw the roach and quickly took my plate and dashed to the kitchen before I had a chance to take a photo.

The only funny and bewildering part to this is that a group of people standing behind me waiting to be seated saw what had happened and witnessed the roach in my noodles and still decided to stay and dine !!!!

FAIR WARNING TO ALL, DO NOT EAT HERE!!! COCKROACHES ARE ALSO DINING AMONG YOU!!!",0
539,"Love this place! I come here almost every week after work for food and drinks. Great cocktails, and great selection of food!",2
1712,"Noodles are what they do best, and that's what brought me back to this restaurant for the second time. It's a budget friendly spot to grab a bite in Chinatown. I really like the texture of the noodles here,  just a bit of chew, but still soft and lots of fun to eat. Everything else that goes with the noodles however doesn't quite stand out. Don't get me wrong, it's still delicious; an unhealthier version of what my mom would make. Maybe I've been spoiled by my moms cooking :p

The stir fried noodles are drowning in oil, and lots of msg used to add flavor to those cold dishes. It's hard to not like it, but so much regrets after. The portions are big but somehow I managed to clean the plate. As I wipe at my oil covered mouth from slurping the stir fried noodle, slowly realizing what I've done, my first instinct is that I should go on a juice cleanse tomorrow. However, as soon as I stepped out of the shop, I'm back to my normal self, thought of juice cleanse replaced by ""what should I have for dinner?""",1
1739,"We were in the neighborhood and couldn't decide what to eat so we did what others would do in our situation which was to bust out our phones and go on Yelp for suggestions! Well Yelp led us to this place based on its high ratings but I'm sad to say that Yelp has failed me again.  This restaurant's dimsum quality was not good. The curry cuttlefish was very watery and bland, their chicken feet had a weird taste, their sui mai was okay but again kind of bland, their spare ribs was full of fat and the list goes on and on with negative things to say about their other dishes. None was good!

Service was okay but their debit machine was down and I didn't have cash on me and when I asked if they take e- transfers, they said no. So I had to drive out to a bank to get cash which was a bit of a pain but of well.

Definitely will not comes back to this one.",0
1330,"Good food, great service! 
Went at 6pm on a Wednesday night, no line-ups yet (when we left at 7pm there was a line-up of 8 people at the door). 
Service was so friendly, they checked in often to see how we were doing. 

Very family friendly place as well. Lots of parents bringing their newborn, hence why the noise level is quite loud. But the energy is great.",2
1370,"I've been to Miku many times for work lunches, but this time I popped by for their winterlicious menu  which was $33 for lunch. The items offered were very similar to their regular menu, which makes this one of the better 'licious menus. I ordered the sashimi plate, the aburi, and their signature matcha cake as a dessert. The quality did not differ from their regular service which is always a good sign of consistency. 

I gave it 4 stars because while it was good, it wasn't the best I've had at this price point. However, I would and do continue to come back as it is so central in the city. I definitely would recommend for first timers who don't want to break the bank for good sushi.",2
1415,"Small portions, and flavors weren't very exciting for ""upscale fusion"". Seemed pretty typical Asian.

Staff was good and attentive.

All in all the atmosphere and experience felt very pretentious.",1
1864,"A solid spot for hand-pulled noodles. I got the wok cumin che mian with beef. There's a lot of well-integrated flavour in the bowl. The noodles have the right texture. Precisely-julienned vegetables are all mixed in so there's a lot going on with each bite. It was labelled spicy but I didn't get a lot of heat.

It's pricey ($16 for what I got) and portions aren't massive, but it sure is tasty.",2
1673,"I think I ordered the wrong broth here. I probably would have enjoyed my meal much more but the broth was overpowering, a lot more pungent than I'm used to. But I powered through it and it ended up being good. So point is, don't get the pickled vegetable with pork broth unless you know what you're getting into! I wish I could come here to try more soups. I love the concept: Piping hot soup still boiling as you dip the veggie and other condiments in. Add a few slices of pork and then the noodles as your last bet. Very presentable and affordable!",1

199,"Who doesn't love a good taco?

I surely do, so I was happy to meet my dining companion at Tacos El Asador, as authentic-sounding a taco joint as I've ever encountered in our fair city.

I decided to go with the Chorizo and the Birria (Goat) tacos, with the latter arriving first. I don't think I've ever eaten goat meat in the context, so I was definitely excited to give this one a try. It didn't disappoint. The meat was cooked perfectly and contained a very flavorful blend of spices, while the two sauces on the table, of which one is impressively hot, effectively enhance the taste of the concoction.

The Chorizo arrived next and while it too was quite good, it didn't blow me away like the first one. It tasted like virtually every other chorizo taco I've ever eaten; there weren't any unexpected flavors at work here, and in fact, the chorizo itself was a little bit on the bland side. I still enjoyed the heck out of it, though, especially when I added those aforementioned sauces.

I also ordered a bowl of their Chicken, Black Beans and Tortilla Soup. I'm no tortilla soup expert, so it's entirely possible this was an above-average variation, but I wasn't impressed. The broth was salty without being flavorful, while the plentiful bits of tortilla got soggy immediately and gave the dish a rather unpleasant texture. I should note, too, that the soup comes with a fairly hefty amount of cheese, which definitely should have been indicated on the menu.",1
1863,"Relatively new noodle spot that opened up downtown just at Bay and Dundas. Came by with a few coworkers for lunch and the consensus was that it was okay. 

Even though Artisan plus was packed when we arrived. We were lucky and was able to get seated fairly quickly for a party of 6. 

We were seated on the high top right in front of the kitchen and got to witness the staff in action. It still amazes me how efficient the kitchen works, it's a well oiled machine. 

I ordered the appetizer trio, pork bun, and clam mashi. The appetizer trio was a combo of enoki, bean curd, and tripe. Of the 3 the tripe stood out the most. The bean curd and enoki mushroom were okay at best. The trio comes with dipping sauce that tasted very similar to a peanut sauce. 

The pork bun was shared among the group and we found that although the pork was really flavourful and moist, the bun itself was a tad on the dry side. Not the good kind either. It's worth a try but I wouldn't be ordering this again if I visited again. 

The clam mashi was amazing! I've gotta say I could have done with without the other two items on the menu but the clam mashi is a must. Be warned, it's a little spicy. I would say out of 10, would be about a 7 on my scale. Not to the point where the heat was unbearable and unenjoyable. It definitely lingers and I found myself going through water pretty quickly. The clams were declines in the dish and there was quite a few in there to enjoy. This was my first time having mashi and I'm now a big fan of that.",1
1256,"I really want to like this place. I really do. I've gone here since 2013, and then I tell myself never again, but it's so close and convenient, etc. But yeah, everytime I go I wonder why it's rated so high by everyone else.

First, banh mi shouldn't take forever to make. Go to any Vietnamese place and the person behind the counter will literally slap together a sandwich in a matter of minutes. They have a team of people working here and it still takes longer somehow.

Second, the banh mi itself (i.e., the bread) doesn't taste right. It's not crunchy on the outside, soft in the middle. As for the rest of the sandwich, there's something about it that lacks authenticity. Atop of this, it's way pricier than it should be.",0
468,"Yum, yum, yum!  I came here with a large group of ladies.  A couple of extra people were added to our reservation on the spot with no problem at all.  We ordered the fixed price menu with 7 courses.  Some of our friends were vegetarian and they were able to make substitutions, also with no problem at all.  

The decor is very cool and artistic.  The large, outdoor patio is great in the summertime and just as lively as inside.  

Delicious food, lovely service.  Can't wait to come back.",2
1117,"Was walking along this area and saw this restaurant and decided to check it out with my fiancé and I'm really glad we did! Their pastas were fresh and tasty and cooked at a good expected al dente. The burrata was a really nice appetizer to start with as it was nice and light, but creamy too. The waiters were helpful and attentive in serving us. 

Nodo is a really decent Italian place without paying an outrageous price.",2
1899,Quick delivery. Everything was nice and hot. The garlic eggplant was sooo good. Pad Thai was average... could have used more sprouts and some peanut. Ordered a curry and a beef dish. Both good. Both came with steamed rice which isn't clear from the menu so no need to order extra rice as I did. Will order again. Eggplant on repeat!,2

815,"I was craving pizza for supper this evening.  I was walking along College Street and came across Trattoria Taverniti.  It looked interesting and I'd never been there so I thought I'd check it out.

When I got here around 6:30pm, it was fairly empty but filled up pretty quickly.

I ordered the Carne pizza.  It was a good pizza and I ended up taking some home for lunch tomorrow.  The crust was crispy and I guess it was the sausage that had a bit of a bite.

I paid my bill and was finishing up my wine, getting ready to go.  Then one of the servers asked if I would move to the patio to a high top chair because they needed my table.  I said I wasn't going to be much longer and didn't want to move to a high top (I have a wonky knee).  About ten seconds later, the second server came over and asked me to move and I told her the same thing.  About five minutes later, one of the servers said I really had to leave because they really needed my table.  I just had a sip of wine left and again said I'd be leaving shortly (and did).  I felt a bit uncomfortable because the table next to mine was looking over and wondering what was going on.

So what started out being a pleasant meal got ruined.  I understand that a small restaurant needs to turn the tables over to make money.  But if the table was reserved and I needed to be gone by 7:30pm (so in about an hour), they should have said so when I was seated so the expectations were set ... rather than kicking me out because someone else needed the table.  Definitely a customer service fail.  As good as the pizza was, I didn't feel valued as a customer so won't be back.",0
538,"It was fun get together at Mariachis last week when me and my friends decided to go here. 
We primarily wanted to try the spicy margaritas. We got the jalepeno cucumber pitcher and the spicy pineapple one. Both were delicious. They got us the frozen style margaritas and I am not sure if they have the on the rocks option. 

During summer they have seating outside which is a small space with quite a few tables in the area. A decent place to sit, however it can get crowded. The place is located on the main road so it's easily accessed. 

We ordered food chicken fajita and our friends got the enchiladas. The fajita were a bit too saucy and wasn't really crisp. We also got some guacamole and that was delicious. So foodwise it was so-so but for drinks it was a really fun place to be!",1
1447,"We decided to check out Chinatown on our first night in Toronto.  We were in search of something authentic that we couldn't find where we live.  There were so many choices that we were having trouble deciding so we did a Yelp search and took a quick look at the reviews.  That led us to this place.  

The restaurant is on the second floor so you will need to look for the stairs beside the sign.  The specials were written on the white boards on the wall.  The regular menu has a ton of choices and some of them I had to look up on the internet.  Our server was very friendly and helpful with questions we had the entrees.  

I ordered the Fried Ho Fun with Beef and Black Bean Sauce.  I've never had a black bean sauce that I didn't like so I knew I would probably like this dish.  I didn't know what Ho Fun was but our server described it as a soft noodle so I decided to step outside my comfort zone and give it a try.  Our server brought a cup of the soup special while our food was being prepared.  I chose a creamy soup with chicken.  It was delicious.  The Ho Fun noodles were very good and the black bean sauce was excellent.  There was too much food for me to finish but I made sure to eat all the beef.  

This was a very enjoyable new food adventure for us.",2
947,"We came to this place attracted by BlogTO's boast of the best lasagna in town. What's a better way to try the place then the Family Meal it has on the menu. For a set price you get to try a little bit of all their well known food.

It comes with appetizers, salads, pasta, and a main course to share.  With all the rave reviews, we thought we were going to have the best meal of our lives.

To note: Their Lasagna was pretty good. It comes in the menu as a small for just under $10 or a bigger pasta size.  I will return just for that.

Everything else, my companion and I were pretty disappointed.  Granted, it should be pretty hard to screw up a salad. Most is just compilation of freshly chopped up raw ingredients.  One of the salads was dressed REALLY sour.  I ended up taking it home and tossing it with more raw vegetables to be palatable.

The pasta sampler plate they provided came with 3 pasta of their choices - this included the legendary lasagna.  It was the ONLY good thing on the plate. One of the pasta was undercooked so it was still crunchy. We had to send it back to be more ""al dente.""

The only control of choice you have was the main dish. We were able to each choose 2 mains individually -  a pork chop and a lamb shank.  That being the highlight of the meal, we were both pretty disappointed too.  The pork chop was way overcook and tough. The lamb shank - well...we had better elsewhere.

We expected a lot more going into the restaurant especially paying over $100 including wine. We both agree afterwards we should had just gotten a lasagna and that's it.

This place was not horrendous but I would not go out of my way to return.",0
996,"This place is definitely overrated and way too crowded.

You'll have to wait over an hour to get seated at one of the restaurants and although the food is more affordable than most Italian restaurants in the city, the wait isn't worth it.

If you go, just grab a few slices of the pizza from the  counter along with a bottle of wine, grab a seat and enjoy that.

I'll only be going back to get cheeses and cold cuts from the market ad this was exceptional.",1

Awesome prices
Honest service

Cons:

I think I may have found my new favourtie Chinese BBQ place.  Again, I have Yelp to thank for this find because you would never find this place otherwise.  Ho Ho Barbeque doesn't face the street so it can be tough to find if you're looking for it in particular.

This place is the definition of a hidden gem.  It's a small place nestled in a plaza at Midland and McNicoll.  The place is super tiny, just enough to fit everything in.  There's 2 chairs and a aisle to sit if you really want, but take out is the way to go.

What stands out immediately is the prices.  Most places now charge close to $10 or more for a pound of BBQ pork.  The price here, $7.50.  You're not comprising quality here for the price too.  The meats here are just as good as anywhere else.  You'll find the prices are about 2 to 3 dollars cheaper across the board for everything you usually find at a Chinese BBQ place.

2 things stand out for me the most here.  First, they have a curry beef brisket.  It's hard to find Chinese BBQ places that to curry beef brisket anymore.  It used to be more frequent but most places have stopped doing it.  You get a large order here for $8.50, that's a win.  

Second, the service her is amazing.  I usually get my BBQ pork a little on the fatty side.  When I placed my order, the butcher took a look and couldn't find any.  Rather than try to sell me something I didn't want and pretend it was still fatty, he honestly told me he didn't have any and asked if I wanted to wait 10 minutes for some new ones that would be fatty.  Let me tell you, most places would not do that.  They would of just chose something remotely close to what I wanted and that would be that.  The fact that he was so honest about what he's selling impressed the heck out of me.

The only thing bad I can say about this place is the cash only policy but that's nothing new for these kind of places.

I love Ho Ho Barbeque.  Like I said, it's my new go to for Chinese BBQ and any fan should definitely try this place out as well.",2
1464,"Thought this place would live to the rating but it fell flat, and flavorless. We ordered our food and it literally came in 2 minutes. (Yikes!)

416,"I was really excited for this place because it had been such a long time since I've had Mexican food. While everything tasted great I was slightly disappointed by the mediocre serving sizes. And warning that the complimentary salsa is very spicy! Also, not that it's the restaurant's fault, but there's a huge sidewalk planter right in front of the entrance which made it pretty much impossible for our stroller to go through. A wheelchair would definitely not be able to pass so heads up. Otherwise seems like a casual and family-friendly place.",1
1379,"Wide range of steaks, that takes your tastebuds for a journey around the world: Japan, US, Australia and even Ontario towns like Uxbridge and Guelph. We dined in the wine cellar, which has a clear wall peaking into the wine cellar and facing opposite their aging room.

First image:
Wagyu (bottom), Guelph (top) with black volcanic salt, miso salt (brown) and sea salt. Each salt had a distinct flavour adding a unique twist to any steak. Sauces were fresh and diverse, chimichurri was my favourite for its fresh ""just picked"" herb taste, Japanese ponzu was a touch too salty, and the Danish blue cheese and bacon (I did not sample)

It's definitely not an everyday dinner, but for a corporate Christmas party or special occasion, Jacobs is a crowd pleasing spot for a delicious meal in a space that encourages learning the story of your meal.",2

This place is the McDonald's of dumplings! Its fast, affordable and delicious! 

So glad my eyes convinced my stomach to try it out. I ordered the soup filled pork dumplings and it was honestly as good as the dumplings I've had at DTF in Shanghai.

-  was served 3 risottos when I asked for one, and was blamed by the staff that I ordered that many
-  risotto was raw as well

I was quite excited to try this place with two friends. The miscommunication ruined the whole experience for me. 

Knowing that the lunch stops at 3pm and that the risotto takes 40 mins to cook. I called in ahead of time to speak to someone around 1:30pm to have my amalfi risotto ready as I was making my way there. I spoke to a server, I informed her that I wanted 1 order of the Seafood risotto for a table of 3 people. I think it was this point where the miscommunication happened. She agreed and said it will be ready for us.

We arrived at 2pm, we spoke to the initial server and I asked him about the risotto, that I called in about. And he's like is it for here or to go? I told him that we were dining in. 

We were seated and waited for 40 mins. Before the risotto came out. To our surprise they brought us THREE RISOTTO dishes. Mind you, on the menu the risotto dish serves 2 people. At no point in time between 2pm to 2:40pm there was any clarification on the order. So I asked the server and informed him that I only wanted 1. So he fetched the server that I spoke to on the phone. And she insisted that I ordered 3 Risottos. I tried to explain to her that party was not ready to eat 6 peoples portion of risotto.

My experience is already ruined at this point. I don't know why she would think that I would want 6 people amounts of risotto. I could've tried other things in the restaurant. 

The risotto itself looked amazing. So if the food was okay I didn't mind.

Unfortunately the risotto was under-cooked. It had a grainy, sandy texture that stuck to the teeth. I informed my guests, and another one agreed with me. I let the server know, he brought Chef Massimo Renzi tableside and he just told me it was cooked al dente, and that he used carnaroli rice. 

So know we're stuck eating extra risotto that was under-cooked. My other friend thought the rice was fine, until he tried the one underneath the top layer. I'm assuming that the chef probably tasted that top layer and thought the other rice cooked as well. 

The seafood in the risotto was perfectly cooked but the dish was spoiled under-cooked rice. 

I think ultimately the experience was ruined when I got 3 Risottos instead of 1. Which caused the quality of control to go down on the rice. 

You will see in the photos that you can see the centre of the rice. Which is an indicator that the rice was raw.",0
1409,"One of the OG restaurants of Toronto's Chinatown. It is a classic ""hole in the wall"" that has stood the test of time. The surrounding area is slowly but surely undergoing gentrification.  I remember a lot more Chinese supermarkets and aunties selling vegetables and other items along the streets. 

The restaurant is small and cramped. If you have a seat near the kitchen doors, be prepared for the stench every time the door swings open. You don't come here for the ambiance/service. You come here for Chinese food. 

Washrooms are in the basement, as with most restaurants in the area. 

Service is as expected from a Chinese restaurant. Effective. 

Ordered:
""Fish sliced noodle soup"": I chose vermicelli, which is thin rice noodles. The ""fish sliced"" is actually a blend of mystery fish made into a cube pre-cooked and sliced. It's probably the same item used for hotpot. Instead of this topping, I'd recommend the fish balls (you really taste the ""fishiness""). 

The soup is clear and very mild in flavour. It's not overly salty. A plus is the vegetables that accompany the soup. 

Observing the other tables' chow meins, rice dishes etc., I believe Markham Chinese food / Congee Queens provide much better value (quantity:price ratio)",1
277,"Came here for lunch, the have an awesome lunch special that you can get  a starter, 2 tacos, and dessert for $16.99 I got the Mexican Street Corn which was amazing, and  a Cod taco and shrimp taco, which were flavourful and spicy. I finished off with a crisp churro and horchata. I highly recxomebt this place",2
1072,"I live in the Yonge/ Egg area and always heard this was supposed to be the best place on Yonge for food as the neighbourhood is quite lacking in the food area to begin with. 

I had high hopes for this restaurant but was gravely disappointed with the service and the food. The flavours they have are all wrong. Most of the food was very pungent and did not have a smooth flow of flavours. It was rather sour the risotto we ordered. We also ordered prawns and the sauces they chose were sour and pungent with too much salt. ( it's all in the sauce for Italian dishes). 

The Gnocchi was okay, it tasted like the Costco brand in a cream sauce ( who could mess up a cream sauce tbh) anyhow I am very disappointed. I did not find the food appetizing at all. The flavours were all mixed up and not great on the palette. 

My waiter unfortunately was very short tempered and seemed agitated the whole time whilst serving my family and I. Whenever we did need something he was never available and would rush off before we finished speaking with him. 

Anyway sad to have to review it like this but that is truly my opinion. 

No match to Campagnolo on Dundas or Buca",0
1070,"This place has been on my list of must-try restaurants in the Yonge-Eg area for quite some time (mostly because of all the high Yelp reviews). However, I was pretty disappointed with my experience. Cleanliness is a really big deal to me, and the restaurant did not feel very clean. There were a LOT of flies buzzing around my table, to the point that I had to swat my hand in between every single bite and was afraid one would fly into my mouth (ew!). The bread was cold, and the pasta was mediocre and at a higher price point. The waiter could see me constantly waving my hand to get the flies out of my face and made no comment. I was not impressed.",0
316,"I came last summer and had an amazing dinner, I remembered the tacos to be rich in flavour and super affordable which was a big stand out to me since a lot of other taco places that charge upwards of $7/8 per taco. I dare to say that this WAS my favourite taco place at the time.

I came back this month for the first time in nearly a year and things were a lot different. For Tacos, I ordered the Biztec de Carne and the Carnita and they ended up tasting exactly the same, which was disappointing and weird since they have a lot of different ingredients altogether. Also there seemed to be a lot of liquid in the taco filling because halfway through eating one of my tacos it fell apart due to the moisture. Also, in all of the tacos, there seemed to be this weird crunchy/salty/sweet ingredient that I couldn't tell what it was. It was really odd, and gave the tacos a weird flavour/texture profile. This was not the same as what I ate a year ago, and they seemed to be more expensive than I remembered.

The one thing that stayed consistent however was their amazing Churro Sundae - everyone in the restaurant seemed to be ordering this. Their Churros were seasoned and cooked perfectly, and the caramel ice cream pairs perfectly - its one of the best churro desserts in the city in my opinion, and would come back just for this.",0
156,"Absolutely delicious! Went with a friend for lunch at sat on their cute and petite outdoor seating. Service was fast and friendly, the food was delicious and extremely fairly priced, and filled my friend and I both up. Be aware that any bill under $10 total needs to be cash- but anything over that they accept credit/debit. Tacos were delicious street style tacos, came out fast and tasty! Guacamole was about average, but still tasty. Would definitely come again sometime!",2
415,"Worst service ever, was yelled at by the head cook when we asked if take out was available because he was too busy and its not worth his time for a small order. His words.  Avoid this place, much better options ""Mariachi"" on Yonge street 2 mins away.  Playa Cabana downtown.",0
1036,"Went for dinner with five friends to celebrate my birthday. The food was excellent until the waiter offer me complimentary dessert. After ""happy birthday"", I dug in to the mini cake. That's when my friend noticed the mould. One of my friends discretely sent the dessert back to the kitchen. The waiter did not offer us a word of apology or a discount. I found that quite surprising and unprofessional. The whole situation left a bad taste in my mouth - not sure I would return.",0
1834,"Found this on Yelp and picked it cause it had a higher rating than the other shops all lined up serving the same thing!

There were only a few people in line for Ho Ho, but there was a line out the door a few shops down. Probably should've gone to the other place, but this one was ok.

Pork was ok. The skin was still crispy when we got back to the hotel. Duck wasn't anything special. Cha siu was ok. This w all about average for us, although I know our moms would say it wasn't good.

Next time, I'll have to try the other place with the longer line.",1

1690,"Best new Chinese place on Spadina. Western Chinese (I.e., Uyghur/halal), quite different from other Chinese restaurants in the area and very delicious. Lunch specials feature unbelievable value and variety. Clientele mostly Chinese. Service is fast and efficient. You would be crazy not to eat here.",2
1569,"This place is conveniently located a couple blocks from Dundas TTC station. It is also a block from Eaton Centre. The place is a bit crammed and a bit small, so be sure to give some waiting time if you are going at noon.

We ordered the special Lanzhou beef noodles. There are a variety of noodle options in varying thickness. The portions are sufficient for some people, but as I am a big eater, I wasn't full from the large. The noodles are good. The soup is a bit bland. And the beef isn't quite flavourful. There is not much memorable about this place, except that the prices are quite unreasonable with respect to the quality.

Overall, I would not recommend this place, but I haven't yet come across a good place for hand-pulled noodles to recommend.",1
26,"This place is always packed, and tonight I found out why.

Wilbur is casual; you order your tacos, burritos, or quesadillas at the counter and you find whatever seating you can (you'll most likely have to share a table with strangers). 

However, this is not a Chipotle:

- The prices are definitely higher...
- .... But the quality of food is immeasurably better (we're talking buttery, flaky, crispy fish tacos and a burrito bowl expertly mixed with guac, carne asada and queso fundido all grooving together)
- They have margaritas on tap - and they're actually AWESOME

Don't worry about the line, it moves fast. Just go!",2
1624,"Well, this was a good place to me after the owner said I have to pay 10% tip? 

This is not a full service restaurant, I actually had to go to the cashier to pay my bill so I wouldn't understand why I have to pay 10%?

It's totally ridiculous! I wouldn't care if the food good or not. It's really pricey as well.",1
108,"For those looking for a more authentic Mexican meal in central TO, this is a great option! Decided to stop in here with a girlfriend for a late lunch and we were happy we did! We started with guc n chips which are a a must with any Mexican meal if you ask me. While the guc was fresh, it was missing salt and the chips didn't appear to be made in house which would have both lead to a 5 versus 4 star rating. I had never had beef tongue tacos so I had to give those a try, especially since my girlfriend who is Spanish highly recommend them and so did the server. Two sauces were offered to add to the tacos and those mixed together tasted excellent! No tongue taste haha :)
We also ordered Margaritas which were terrific! 
Service was friendly and fast. The prices were also great. I'll recommend the spot and would definitely return.",2
1137,"We sat at the patio which has great street view and perfect for summer. But be aware that you can't order drinks if sitting outside.

My girlfriend and I shared calamari and seafood pasta. The calamari wasn't the fried ones as I thought, but still yum, tender and juicy. The seafood pasta had shrimp and mussel was great too, love the tomato sauce they made.

The waiter constantly checked our table and added water, great service.

Overall great dining experience.",2
688,"For a few years I've heard about this place, drove by this place, promised myself I'd stop by one day....and it finally happened!  It's an unassuming little cafe - tucked inside a medical building so it might be easy to miss - there is a sign out front indicating the cafe is in the plaza.

I checked in on Yelp and luckily check in offer is a free cap/latte/tea - yeah!   I also ordered a slice of the veggie pizza b/c I was a little hungry.  They do have a pretty good food menu - from breakfast items, to pizzas to pastas.  

Seating is in the front - a few tables and off to the side in a little room - which is so nice - fireplace, clean tables, nice art.  

The veggie pizza (the menu says they use whatever seasonal veggies they have on hand) was pretty good - medium crust, nice and crispy crust and you could see the veggies - mushrooms, peppers.  Not like some veggie pizzas where everything is diced up so fine you can't see anything.  It came with a little side salad.

I ordered the latte and it was nice - smooth and flavourful and they do latte art here!  I got the teddy bear :)  

I could hear the owners/staff greeting a lot of customers - so I assume quite a few people are regulars (assuming they are coming in to the medical offices first).  

I'll definitely be back!",2
804,"- Not worth for its price. Both service and quality of food. 
- Pappardelle very hard not fully cooked
- Risotto hard as well 
- In this city when there are so many Italian restaurants to compete with, this type of quality simply unacceptable. 
- The lady who served us seemed very unhappy and no smile during the whole dining period.  At the end of the mains, she wiped the dinning table but did such a sloppy job that all crumbles fell on my lap.  I do not know the purpose of doing it. 
- the ""supervisor"" or the manager walked around the room and consciously or subconsciously patted our velvet lounge chair to tell us hurry up cause we might have chatted too long and eating too slow.  
Overall, we are a group of three and we picked this place for our Japanese friend's visit for our first time. None of us would return again.  Pure disappointment.",0
1615,"Went there because craving for dumplings and saw good reviews online. Their shop is a bit old style but that isn't a matter.

Service: Their understandings of English is really low. I know they're Asian but still communication is key especially running a business. Realized most asian restaurants nowadays required customers to write on a paper for ordering

Food: Food was delicious! Handmade and freshly made to order. Like the chewiness of the noodles and the thinness of the dumplings.

However, they gave me 11 dumplings rather than a dozen. I didn't give a tip because of the poor communication and missing food but they complained about that :/",1
1687,"This place is not as good as expected because of the following reasons:

1. Shredded lamb with pancakes were dry and not fresh and portions for the lamb skewers were extremely small compared to some other tables. They should have equal portion sizes for all customers. 
2. The Western Chinese lamb rice is a strange combination of what seemed like sweet potato and the rice was clumped together. It did not taste good. 
3. The membership system is ridiculous as the normal prices have a huge difference for each item listed on the menu. They should provide members to have a discount over the total bill instead. 
4. My friend had food poisoning shortly after leaving the restaurant.

For these reasons, I would be reluctant to come back as there are many places that offer much better quality and portions.",0
1476,"TERRIBLE AND EXTREMELY RUDE SERVICE! LEFT DISAPPOINTED WITH THE QUALITY OF FOOD. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND ANYONE TO GO.

My parents and I came here on a Sunday afternoon for lunch. We ordered Singaporean fried rice noodle and the 15 steamed chives, egg, and dry salty fish dumplings for $10.99.

1. Noodles came out first (really small portions) and then they gave us the bill. We were like what??? Where is our second dish? And they were confused. They then realized they forgot our dumplings.

2. Dumplings came and only 14 out of 15 showed up. We let it slide. 

3. Zero eggs and salty fish in the dumplings. ONLY CHIVES 

4. When my parents paid the bill, the waitress got angry at us and asked why we didn't tip ... but we did tip and it was underneath the bills. So we were like ""excuse me??? Did you even look to see?"" She flips it over and sees the tip and then changes her energy completely and starts saying thank you. This woman had the audacity to get angry at customers who she treated so poorly yet actually still tipped. Im actually speechless.

Additionally, if you're asian and you complain about the food they just get pissed right back at you. And they tell you your opinion doesn't matter cause the Caucasian people don't seem to mind. Terrible",0
713,"Came here with a craving for something creamy and truffle-based. Lucky for me, I scoped the restaurant ahead of time and was completely entranced by others' photos of their Mafalde ai Funghi ($23). 

Cutting straight to the chase, the pasta was everything I wanted and needed it to be. It was delicious, creamy, earthy.. yum.. it hit just the spot! Portions were fair, especially since cream sauce pastas are so heavy, but I did find myself wanting some more protein in my meal and ended up sharing an order of mussels with my partner.

Although on the more expensive side, I have yet to find myself a better creamy truffle pasta so I guess I'll just have to take the hit whenever I crave this dish! (But if you know of a better place, please do hit me up in my messages!)",2
788,"This restaurant is really for the experience. With such a lovely ambience and outstanding service from all staff, the food did not meet up to par with what you may expect.

For starters the food is on the higher price end, and smaller quantities. Although, it is all homemade pasta!! 

I've had homemade pasta before so I had high standards walking in.. I was so excited to try the Gnocchi because well, I LOVE Gnocchi. 

However, I was disappointed. The pasta itself was quite soft and seemed soggy with the red sauce altogether. There was no 'bite' to it, more of a 'mush'. I did not enjoy my meal and that left a significant impression on my take of what the rest of the entrees may be like. 

Note: Calamari & Earl Grey tea were delicious!",0

1594,"Another year has passed by and the HK-style ""Lobster Mountain"" is now back with a mix of fries & fried anchovies. This was a pleasant surprise as they did away with the anchovies/smelt fish citing rising costs several years ago. It caused a bit of a stir, but now the mix is the best of both worlds: east meets west fusion! Kids certainly don't mind the fries. So it's great when restaurants listen to customer feedback.

Fishman Lobster Clubhouse is still the place for the ultimate seafood experience at reasonable prices. With a reservation, we were seated shortly upon arrival. Made our order, and a big fresh 5.5 lb lobster was brought to our table for photos. The wok-tossed Lobster Mountain always impresses, not only based on presentation but also because each huge piece is crispy, slightly spicy, and still very succulent and tender. The other dishes also pair well: silkie chicken soup, snow peas, lobster roe fried rice and sea bass which were more than enough for our table of 3. This year dessert was even elevated with macarons; I usually find these treats overly sweet but here it was perfect. No wonder some people come to Toronto just to try this restaurant.

Occasionally, I hear complaints about their no-nonsense service. But they were very courteous despite the fast pace of service for Lunar New Year dinner. Our dishes arrived quickly, tea was replenished, full plates of shells were replaced. Even the leftovers were packed by a smiling waiter. Funniest thing was when another waiter with the bill offered to give us a toony for exact change. He even wished us well for the new year, just amazing service!",2

Unfortunately, our server was a bit snooty. She didn't seem to approve of our ordering style, which was surprising considering the menu seemed to emphasize shareables. We preferred to try many small plates as opposed to a main. Nonetheless, she kept pushing for more; insisting the sides and rice were meant to be paired with a main protein.",1
409,"I would rate this place a 3.5.  The decor was greatly outdated.  The food was tasty Mexican food, nothing wrong with anything my table got.  Just be weary, if you're not into spice make sure you know what you're ordering with the waiter.  The pictures everyone has posted is exactly what we got.

In terms of the service, it was a one man show.  I get what other reviews mean about the service.  This older gentleman (maybe owner?) took the orders, showed people to their seats, bused the tables, refilled water, etc.  He did everything 2-3 waiters would do.  No surprise that getting his attention would be difficult.  We had no issues with the service.  

FYI, if your mouth is on fire from the chorizo or other spicy sauces, Hollywood Gelato is only a few buildings north.",1

I came here after reading many good reviews about how tasty their food was.  I looked for something to grab it home after picking up my adorable macarons at DaanGo Cake lab.


We ordered 3 boxes of meat on rice; one with roasted pork, another one was roasted duck and the last one was bbq pork.  It comes with either tofu or vegetable on the side.  We only chose vegetable because my husband isn't a fan of tofu. You can also choose to have either a drink or soup along with your meal too.  The price for bbq meat on rice is around $6.50-$8.50.  Isn't it a good deal?  The staff was very nice and friendly.  I wasn't sure if they were the owners or not. I really couldn't tell.  I don't live in the area and it was my first time here. 

The portion was generous however the meat was quite dry.  The bbq pork was ok.  It was better than the roasted pork and roasted duck.  The roasted pork wasn't crispy as I expected and there was little meat on the roasted duck.  

As all above, the food I ordered was mediocre or maybe it wasn't my day.  Anyway, the price was good.  Three meals were only $22.50!  It's pretty good right!?",1

While I was snacking on my Monterrey Steak Taquito, the owner was super chill and chatted about how he sources most his ingredients from Mexico and really strives for quality over quantity when it comes to the fillings he cooks up. I could tell he was telling the truth with the tender steak and crisp tortilla I bit into. He also puts in JUST the right amount of filling! Only thing I would critique on is that I'd prefer a guacamole with a thicker consistency.",2
327,"Been visiting this place since it was on Bloor, so I'm obviously a fan. 

The food is excellent, and continues to be so, with the exception of the guacamole. It's very smooth and soft, not chunky at all. I find it to be overly citrusy, with lack of garlic taste. Reminds me of store bought super bright green guacamole that never seems to go bad . Skip the guac, and just smash an avocado at home. Everything else I've tried here has been great (tacos, tostadas).

The service has never been amazing, but has declined significantly. On my last visit, we weren't given water until 20 minutes after we were seated. Cocktails took a whopping 30 minutes. It felt awkward and kinda embarassing to try to emphatically wave down the uninterested server. After food was brought out, we weren't checked on until, once again, I found myself waving down server for our bill.

Long story short, when I received the bill, I expressed my concern with the service. The explanation honestly pissed me off. They said the service is messed up because they have too many Uber eats orders. I told him you can't have Uber eats impacting your dine in patrons, but apparently you can. We live in a new world where restaurants can probably survive off of online orders. Either way, waiting 20 minutes for water isn't an Uber issue.",1

Cons: dirty table, staff overworked, hard to get a table after lunch still, difficulty finding the best vegetarian/chicken options, some waiters can't communicate in English that well though are super nice and try hard 

Summary: I ordered chicken despite wanting vegetarian but am new to eating more veggie options so I tried to just get the Chicken stir fry. It was all chicken, too much salt and barely any veggies. I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again but I'd be open to getting a ramen dish. My mom got beef so I couldn't really try it, I only tried the noodles.

The people were pleasant, though not overly friendly. 

Its cash only, that in my book makes things difficult. 

The wait is long, I had to wait (I was told) 25-30 mins for three tacos. To me they just need to sort out their process to get through orders faster. I understand you have one big order before me and you want to be authentic, but there must be efficiencies.

Maybe if you offered like chips while I wait it would smooth things out for me.

It's delicious and authentic like I said, but not sure I'd wait another 30 mins for tacos.",1
1853,"3.5/5 

Came here for a quick lunch since I heard a lot about the Yonge and finch location of this noodle spot. We were quickly sat down and  able to place our order. 

We both got the Biang Biang Mien since it was recommended by the waitress and seemed to be the most popular item from others who came to this place. 

The noodles were interesting given the variety of different toppings that you wouldn't necessarily think go together, but I liked the mixed noodles concept. My biggest issue was that despite there being so many different toppings, the noodles tastes bland and didn't have much flavour to them. It seemed like the toppings weren't cooked enough to bring out the flavours or salted enough to help. 

Overall an interesting noodle concept but I don't think I'd return again.",1

756,"First time at Stelvio- wasn't as good as I'd hoped. 

We ordered some fritti mozzarella bites and they were good- but definitely needed a dipping sauce. Or maybe I'm just too used to real mozzeralla sticks with marinara. 
I wouldn't recommend it.

I ordered the pasta special which was a gnocchi with truffle, meat, and porcini. When I first got it I was happy that it came with a lot of truffle, but when I got into it I felt like it had too much. It was definitely too much of a good thing. But it was $28 so I guess they wanted you to feel like you got bang for your buck. 

My bf ordered the tagliatelle ragu and it looked good, but he said the primary flavour was salt. When I tried it- I would have to agree. It was tomato and salt. Not complex at all. 

Also as an aside- I would say the pasta portions are relatively small for the price. You get this dish with a little bowl dent in the middle and your pasta portion is basically the size of a rice bowl. 

I'm happy I tried it but I probably wouldn't come back.",1
780,"For so many years, I have never visit Terroni.  Actually after dinner tonight I don't think there's an urgent need as everything was normal and on the pricey side.

Was looking at the mushroom pasta special for Monday and the cost was  31.  I asked the waiter what's the portion sIze and he told me 5 pieces.....really?!

OK I went with the grilled calamari for $18 and a side of rapini for $10 instead.  Well, the calamari was alright, I like the tomato arugula salad a lot underneath but the rapini wasn't good as it was super hard to chew.

My friends had the $170 steak combo which came with a salad and a plate of veggies and it tasted good.

So my verdict is 2.5 stars  round up to 3 here we don't have half star option for review.  Prob won't be back tbh.",1

We got:

-grilled fish tacos 
-bean/cheese quesadilla 
-chicken quesadilla 
-beef tacos
-beef burrito 
-fried plantain

-4 beers/$10 Sunday deal

3 stars because the portions are on the small side for what you pay. One hungry person will need at least two orders of tacos plus a side to fill them up. Service was ok but seemed a bit disinterested. 

The churro was very very good. I recommend for desert. That was probably the dish that stood out the most. 

The venue itself is nicely designed and a cool hangout spot. I'm happy to have a place like this in the neighbourhood especially because there are not a ton of sit down Mexican restaurants in the east end. They definitely fill a niche. Food is fine but nothing to write home about. Worth a try but it won't knock you off your feet. You will be annoyed by the lack of parking but not much one can do about that.",1
517,"Really delicious food that takes a twist on traditional Mexican cuisine. Tried the mixto ceviche, sweet potato, salad, octopus and wagyu beef steak. Beautiful interior, not too dark, not too loud. 4 stars given due to prices but food is 5/5!",2
550,"The food there is amazing, and I'm a fan of this place now :)

The Guacamole and Corn Tortillas are the must to order!!!

Overall, the food is amazing there and I will definitely go back for another round.",2
1103,"Top 5 best meals and service I've ever had! The wine suggestions were on the spot. We ordered the Bruschetta and cocktail shrimp, which was a nice start. Several of us agreed the cocktail sauce was one of the best we've had.  

The entrees were all delicious. I had the Butternut squash ravioli. So rich and flavorful. It's Not on the menu so you have to ask for it if it's not announced on the specials. 

Honestly, after trying my friends dishes as well, I don't think you can go wrong here.",2

1064,"Loved the service and the food 
Great place , the ambiance is delightful 
Order this fish dish , absolutely yummy",2
1769,"We tried this place since it's close to our hotel and shopping places. 
The ambiance was great and place looks clean. But the service needs a lot of work. The hot and sour soup is terribly spicy and no taste. Just the hot spice. So I ordered another soup. The wonton soup. It took them almost 30 minutes to bring my soup out. And likewise no taste and very UN-CHINESE flavor. 
We also asked one waiter about a cocktail mix and he initially gave me the impression that he does not want to be asked about the drinks and the menu. The waiter said I'll get back it's you but he never did come back. Almost All waiters and servers here are very UNFRIENDLY AND NO SMILE at all. Very disappointing place.!!!!",0

Good authentic food,  fresh, delicious,  good flavor and good beers too!
 Try it",2
1034,"Freshly made, high quality ingredients. However for me, it was made with too much pepper and it was lacking flavour and creaminess. If an egg yolk was used, I could not taste it. I usually love carbonara, but I would not order this again.",1
1588,"Not for everyone, maybe an acquired taste. Had the Sichuan pickled basa as per other reviews and the flavours were just too strong. It would be nice to have a smaller portion version so new customers could try a wider spread and not feel so locked in. The single large $30 slightly tongue numbing, gingery sour soup was too much of a commitment for two people. Good initial taste but then it just becomes overwhelming. Definitely need a lot of rice for this dish.",0
1574,"Dining here on a Saturday night was a 30 mins wait on the waitlist for a group of four. There was a small waiting area so it wasn't terrible but heads up, the place is pretty noisy

We ordered the ""boiled clams"", the ""Sichuan Picked Flavoured Beef in soup"", and their iced plum green tea

The clams were def a hit and a very reasonable price ($8) we really enjoyed the flavour and quality of the dish

The beef soup sadly was a ""miss"", the beef shavings were decent quality but the taste wasn't enjoyable. Too many peppercorns were left in the dish and slightly tasted off ( I'm unsure if stale or...) 

Tbh the spice level is manageable and not over the top, I just found the flavour to be subpar for Sichuan soup dishes 

The plum green tea isn't a fave either, extremely sweet and diluted (tastes like a watered down freezie )",1
1791,"This restaurant was formerly known as ""Sichuan Garden Restaurant"" and re-opened last year as ""Ten Miles B.B.Q"".  After reading positive reviews about their Dan Dan Noodles and Sichuan cuisine I popped in alone for a quick lunch.  I was greeted with a very confusing menu.   I wanted to order a few sides, but was advised by the server that my selections were too small. She did not suggest any alternatives.  All of the multiple small plates seem to have only one ingredient and no options for combination dishes like a mixed vegetable platter. I am happy to pay more for more content, but $12 for just bok choy? $6 for one small skewer of basic mushrooms? had to call her over twice until she finally helped me narrow it down to Dan Dan Noodles and a mushroom pot. I was hungry and desperate to order anything at this point.  THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE THE FOOD ARRIVED.  The Dan Dan Noodles were tasty, but after that the server and kitchen staff seemed to prioritize take out orders over mine.  At about 45 mins + from when I walked I had to flag two servers to ask about the mushroom pot I had ordered.  The kitchen staff had only just started the dish! At that point I paid for what I had eaten and walked out.    If you want UNHELPFUL ,SLOW & UNATTENTIVE servers and kitchen staff that (prioritize Uber Eats orders over sit down guests) and don't own up to their mess ups than you might enjoy this restaurant.  I myself will NEVER RETURN.  There are thousands of restaurants in the GTA. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY on this one! P.S. The management was non-existent. P.P.S. THEY GAVE ME THE BILL BEFORE I HAD EVEN RECEIVED THE FOOD!",0
592,"3.5. Actually. We were attempting to visit the Seven Lives Pop Up on Bloor, but the door was locked on Friday night at 7pm. We had seen the sandwich board for Los Guaca Moles on the street and decided that fate wanted us to visit this place instead. 

They were insanely busy during the dinner rush and we sat at the bar for a while waiting while the two staff who were running the bar and the floor got caught up. I have no problem with slow service as long as they keep the drinks coming. They were also apologetic and thanked us for our patience. 

We ordered the Guacamole with crickets which was a decent size and there was nothing wrong with the chips despite what other reviewers have said. The bartender brought us some nice habernero sauce that had a wonderful spice that sneaks up on you. The Pulpo Tostadas were bit too sweet for me. The octopus was tender, but the sauce ruined the flavour a bit for me. I aded more habernero sauce and they were better.

Tacos were loaded with fillings. The fish was dusted in cornmeal and cooked to soft perfection. Chorizo was interesting and quite good, but I""ll confess I only ordered it because they didn't have the liver taco available. The Lengua (tongue) taco was my favourite and reminded me of Mexico. 

There were also a few items going out that looked really delicious and unique to the restaurant. I'd love to go back and try out. 

Overall, I think Los Guaca Moles may be going through a few growing pains, but this leaves more room for them to grow! I'd go back and give them another go. The atmosphere was fun and intimate without being too crowded and I'd love to check out their cozy patio on a warmer night.",1
1842,"Ordered a whole roast duck. One of the worker says to me that he had to cut the duck inside the kitchen. While I came home and opened the take out boxes, one of the box was full but the other box was half full and there were a lot of ducks's necks to replace the empty space. I have assumed they stole some of the goods part of the duck for their combo rice meal and they make $$$ out of that. No wonder that they had to cut the duck inside the kitchen so that you can not see what they are stealing. I had call my friends and they say the same thing.  The duck was good and you can taste the freshness and was not frozen but you lost me as a customer for life. The reasons why I brought the roast duck from them at that time because the other two Chinese roast meat place in the same area was closed due to Covid 19 and they was the only place open for Chinese roast meat. Words of month travel very fast and your business will suffer because of this unethical practice.
Now I know how they are able to sell the rice combo meals so cheap.
Buyers Beware.",0
1529,"5/5 venue. Super clean (even the washrooms) for a Chinatown establishment and beautiful interior design -- traditional Beijing palace style! Super cool place to take a date or someone not so familiar with the Chinese culture for an ""authentic"" experience.......

But 3/5 food. Why? No major flaws with taste or quality, but unfortunately the dishes are just kind of boring. The regional cuisine served here is northeastern Chinese, which is my specialty since I hail from Shandong, as do the owner and some of the staff! I find the dishes very clean in that I feel that 98 Aroma uses less corn starch, oil, sodium, and possibly MSG than many other Chinatown restaurants.

3/5 value. Portion sizes are reasonable, but don't expect anything huge that would last for a week for under $10 like at House of Gourmet, etc. Pricier than most Chinese restaurants, but 98 Aroma can get away with this since they do have a swankier and more fusion feel. Think R&D, but with more Chinese-influence. A good place to take your Caucasian coworkers or in-laws, but not to dine alone just because. 

A few notes about specific dishes-

1. I've had the soups here before and the Hot & Sour soup is actually a huge portion even as a small size. The delicate mushrooms soup is not as substantial, so cannot stand alone as a meal.

2. Do order the Summer Breeze Veggie Salad (vegan) -- and make sure you MIX it well as all the sauce (and flavor) is at the bottom of the bowl. $9.99. Big portion, enough to share between 2 people or have as a lighter meal. I loved the textures and glass noodles.

3. Very mediocre Assorted Delicate Veggies (vegan). Broccoli, celery, carrots, and fried tofu. $14.99. Way too basic.

4. My gfs had the scallion pancakes, which looked more cooked and crispier than the ones my mom makes at home, but gfs enjoyed these. 

5. Can't remember the menu name, but gfs ordered a huge ass chicken udon stew, which was massive. They really liked the chicken and flavors here. 

6. Fried green beans with minced beef -- beans were oily and gfs weren't a fan. $13.99.

They take credit, debit cards at no extra charge. We didn't make a reservation for 7PM on a Friday night and were seated immediately, so customer volume is definitely not as high as it used to be a year ago.

Overall, would return, but only with Chinese food novices or for a special occasion.",1
1797,"Amazing for a few dishes. Meh for some others. Know your dishes before you order.

Gong Bao Chicken is AMAZING. Best Gong Bao Chicken I've had anywhere.
The fish in spicy oil is good too.

Some of their other dishes, not so much. Came here with some non-asian friends, the stuff they ordered was gah. So essentially, good restaurant IF you know what to order.",2
1566,"This place is uber busy during the lunch rush, there's usually a line, though it does move pretty fast. It was also very cramped inside and difficult to maneuver without bumping into ppl. Other than that, this place had a solid bowl of beef noodles. I asked wht the waiter recommended and tbh i can't remember which one we got--it was a few months ago. But tbh id prefer mei nung beef noodle house in markham. I'd come back here if i'm looking for noodle soup dt.",2
999,"Finally made it to this place for a late lunch. Even though it was late lunch, this place is busy and bustling with people. 

Walked around 2nd floor and went to a pizza and pasta joint. Even though the place was busy, the servers moved fast to clean and set us up. 

Saw the menu and heard the special for the day. We got some fresh mozzarella, pasta dish (I didn't dare to try to butcher the name of the dish in front of the Italian server) and the pizza special (ate too fast and almost forgot to take a picture). 

Food came out quite fast, and mozzarella was fresh and light. Pasta was light, al dente and had the right flavour. Pizza was the Neapolitan style, tasty and did not feel heavy at all. 

I would rate the entire place a 3.5 stars, rounding up to a 4. It's quite good with service and food.",2
1866,"Tried out this newish place at bay and Dundas. The menu describes the food as northern Chinese and simple. While the ingredients are all fresh, I think they've taken the ""simple"" a bit too far. I tried the short-rib beef dish. The broth is basic and does not have much flavour. That said, the veggies were all fresh and delicious. Just needed a bit more flavour to kick the dish up a notch. 

Decor-wise, the place is hip and modern. Staff are all very friendly and can explain the dishes. Food comes out fast. May try this place again and try a different dish",1
1344,"Just had a delicious dinner here with friends. I'm usually not a fan of Thai food, but every main we tried here was flavourful and well made. Had the red curry (such a complex sweet-rich curry, top pick!), three flavours pad Thai (great taste), and pad kee mao. We also shared the squash fritters, which were not that special or worth it in my opinion. 

Interior decor is ecclectically colourful and the tables were packed. We arrived at 5:30pm on a Sunday and essentially got the last spot. 

Definitely recommend for a date or get together with friends.",2
729,"Their mafalde ai fungi pasta is delicious (although heavy). Their wine selection is pretty good, service is decently quick. It's a great restaurant that brings in a diverse crowd. Although I didn't eat it, their pizza looks good too. Overall, great option to eat Italian in Yorkville!",2
1647,We ordered through Uber eats. The driver was quick and really friendly. The food was hot and not too expensive. Otherwise the food was not our favorite. Out of everything we enjoyed the spring rolls the best. The rest of the food was pretty bland and not a lot of flavor. It was fulfilling and we were hungry so it wasn't the worst thing.,0
1110,"A girlfriend took me here for my birthday celebration. Loved the ambience here, and we were lucky enough to be seated on the upper deck patio. Beautiful space - the deck was covered by a huge tree decorated by fairy lights. This made it feel like we were in a completely differently place altogether, away from the hustle and bustle of Downtown Toronto. 

The room next to the upper deck had a family celebrating a birthday; and there was a lady playing the accordion for them. Almost felt like we were in Italy!

I'm giving this restaurant a 3 stars rating solely because of the food. I had the Zuppa Di Pesce, which I asked the sauce to be replaced with the rosé sauce.  I wasn't very impressed with the pasta considering the price. Both in taste and in the seafood quality. 

Service at this restaurant was great - we casually brought up that it was my birthday and they brought a complimentary tiramisu as a surprise! So wonderful! 

I would certainly come back here for drinks/appetizer considering how amazing the space is!",1
1306,"MY FAVOURITE ice cream place in Toronto! The waits in the summer and fall time are no joke, but come here after a nice dinner and wait in line to burn off those dinner calories ;) 

Their flavour combos are so unique, but also yummy and it's good on its own, in a waffle cone, normal cone, or in between cookies!

My personal favourites are rosewater lychee, good humour me, coconut mango puddin, and boba papa milk tea 

Pro tip: always get 2 flavours and if you really like one that's available in the pint size, take that to go for home",2
303,"We decided to drop by on a late Saturday night, the place was busy but we were lucky to wait only 15 minutes. We ordered the Street Corn, Beer Battered Haddock Tacos, Crispy General Tao Tacos, BBQ Beef Brisket Taco and Pork Shoulder Burrito. 

The Street Corn came out - and was absolutely delicious! The cream sauce on top was the perfect sauce for it. 
When the tacos came out, the Crispy General Tao Taco's sauce seemed to have drenched all the other ones as well, so the tacos were very soggy, and didnt leave much of an impression. Out of the three the Haddock was definitely the best.  Lastly, we the burrito came out, and that was delicious. The salsa, the rice, and meat were so tender it came together perfectly. Overall we enjoyed our dinner at Chula, and would probably come back to check it out in the summer on their patio. We found the indoor restaurant to be a bit cramped (especially the front of the house).",1
631,"Was here to celebrate my bestfriend's birthday. To start of with the service, I thought it was ok..we always had to ask for water refills. I didn't feel that the service was upscale enough for such a sophisticated, classy Italian restaurant.

Our server was knowledgeable and he made some recommendations. He suggested our party to order the Antipasto Gordonia ($24.95 pp) to share as we were all seafood lovers. I enjoyed the grilled calamari and tiger shrimps but everything else on that platter was mediocre. In terms of main, I ordered the Spaghetti Alla Carbonara ($22.95). The texture of the pasta was cooked to perfect al dente which I love. Flavour was rich but a bit too salty for my liking. My other friend who ordered a tomato based sauce mentioned her dish tasted like something she can make at home herself. Overall, food was just ok; nothing special. 

I probably won't come back as I feel that this one time experience is enough for me unless a friend of mine plan to host a party here in the future.",1
1750,"Went today with my boyfriend to try the dim sum over the weekend and was disappointed. Got there at 1:30 PM and ordered about four or five different dim sum's and was told to wait while it was being made. 

The order was for take out. Waited for an hour and a bit and still no end in sight of when I would get my order. I must've seen five Uber eats pick up their orders way after me and there were two or three people behind the line that got seated for dine in, and got served their food before me getting my order. 

After waiting patiently for an hour for my take out order to be completed I went up to the cashier and told them to cancel our order since it wasn't even made at that point. All they said was that they were really backed up. I spoke to both workers and said this isn't right that you guys didn't tell us we have to wait A whole hour for take out. We have been standing at the restaurant at the lineup for a whole hour and still our order was not made at that point in time. Poor Organization.",0
969,"I have to confess I am a pasta monster. I would be happy eating lunch everyday here at Famiglia Baldassarre for the rest of my life. Sadly they only open 4 days a week.

Arrived early before the place was opened on a overcast chilly afternoon. The wait was minimum and we got to order the 2 pasta of the day, a Crudo and Asparagus to share. 

Nothing can replaced the taste, the mouth feel of freshly made pasta. Their menu changed daily so you always in for a treat and wondering what you going to have for lunch today.

The Prosciutto crudo is a steal at the price. Must order! 

Sometime truffle might be available? Truffle is just magical.

Everything tasted so fresh, pure and wholesome. A taste of love and caring prepared by an Italian mamma?

Just go and you find out what you had been missing in your life. Make sure you bring Cash!",2
634,"One of the most celebrated names in Italian food in Toronto is Buca. With two locations in the city, Chef Rob Gentile's original restaurant opened in 2009 in the Fashion District. You don't have to look far to find the accolades. Canada's 100 Best Restaurants listed them at #3 in 2015, #17 in 2016, #16 in 2017, #44 in 2018, and #45 in 2019. Toronto Life has them at #39 on their The City's 100 Best Restaurants 2018 list. And blogTO calls them the #1 Best Italian Restaurant in the city. What's the difference between the (original) Fashion District location and the one in Yorkville? It's mainly that the Yorkville restaurant focuses more on seafood offerings while the Fashion District upholds the classics that everyone loves. Both locations are excellent and offer the exact same consistency and high level of culinary perfection.

The word ""buca"" in Italian translates to hole. Which makes sense because the restaurant pretty much resides in one. Formerly a boiler room, the space is now an expansive and gorgeous restaurant comprised of towering ceilings, all of the exposed brick that you could imagine, and industrial-cool light fixtures. Where the Yorkville location feels more polished and modern, this one is rustic and mysterious. It actually feels a bit like dining in a wine cellar, among stacked bottles and wine barrels. Finding the entrance on King Street can be a little bit tricky because the signage isn't extremely obvious and you have to enter through the laneway. Then you proceed down the stairs and into the depths of the subterranean feast that awaits you. I visited on a Saturday evening - for my birthday, no less. The room is always full of customers and a reservation is certainly recommended.

Met by the friendly and professional staff at the bottom of the stairs, our coats were whisked away and we were seated at our table immediately. The experience felt special right from the very start.

In need of a beverage, I found myself looking over the list of seasonal and house cocktails. I also appreciated the addition of virgin cocktails, because there are certainly times when I don't feel like drinking alcohol but still appreciate the opportunity to order something interesting. However, this wasn't one of those times and the seasonal Frutto Divino (Fresh persimmon puree, calvados, chamomile, lime, egg white - $17.00) was calling to me. The persimmon in this 2oz cocktail caught my attention as it's my favourite seasonal fruit around the holidays. The egg white is the component that sealed my decision. This beverage was expertly mixed and tasted grown-up yet sweet at the same time. I loved the punchy zip from the lime and the fragrant sweetness from the persimmon.

The food at Buca is very serious business, although it somehow feels relaxed. The locally sourced, constantly changing menu involves ingredients that are seasonal and source specific. Nose-to-tail cooking is embraced at Buca (which I especially love). The hospitality is also top-notch, with every staff member exuding a welcoming and knowledgeable disposition. I was so ready to eat!

One famed menu item that I'd kept hearing about over and over was the Salumi di Buca (Selection of 5 salumi served with seasonal preserves - $32.00), a platter of incredible artisan cured meats. So of course the feast began with that. From left to right:

Speck: (which comes with the gnocco fritto, see below).

Petto d'Oca: Cured goose breast, cinnamon, clove, orange.

Salame Toscano: Cured beef sausage, black pepper.

Finocchiona: Cured pork sausage, black pepper, fennel.

Soppressata: Cured beef sausage, calabrese spices.

Salsiccine: Spicy calabrese style pork sausage.

We also added the Gnocco Fritto (Tuscan spiced dumplings, speck - $10.00), a personal favourite, which was served on the same board. This whole entire situation was heavenly. Served with an acidic eggplant preserve (which served amazingly to cut through some of the fat), the beautiful presentation of meats ranged from spicy soppressata to a decadent goose breast that tasted like Christmas. Each one was unique, expertly seasoned, and fragrantly herbed. Largely based in seasonal offerings, I want to keep returning to order this so that I can try different meats every time. A beautiful sharing experience.

The gnocco fritto, a warm, pillowy fried bread, especially owns my soul. From the perfectly uniform shape of each one, to the steamy aroma as you tear them apart, these are what dreams are made of. Served with buttery, melt-in-your-mouth speck, an intensely flavourful cured ham.

I also couldn't resist the Nodini (Warm bread knots, olive oil, rosemary, garlic - $8.00). At this point I was willing to accept that this meal was going to be extremely carb-heavy. I mean, who says ""no"" to perfect little bread balls? A golden, buttery crust on the outside that gives way to a warm and soft inside. All soaking in a garlicy bath.

So things were going well.

Next I took my attention to the Paste section because",2

I tried the shrimp one and the mushroom one and they were both delicious and filling. Staff is super friendly and were not annoyed by the baby that was with us. Tiramisu was not bad.

1774,"We were wandering through Yorkville and looking for something to eat when we spotted Dynasty Chinese Cuisine. Dim sum in the middle of Yorkville? Sure, why not.

We requested a seat on their patio and the waiting began. Our waiter finally showed up with menus a few minutes later but honestly, I was baffled (and a little annoyed) by its vagueness. The dim sum menu is devoid of prices, and since our waiter appeared only sporadically, we had to wait a while before we could even begin choosing our food. (Like, if everything is going to cost $10, we certainly weren't going to stay. And because this is Yorkville, that's absolutely a possibility.)

Anyway, he finally explained the menu and the costs, so we decided to order six items. The food was all fine. There were no really distinctive flavors to be found but everything was prepared relatively well. (We did get a short-rib dish that was basically inedible due to a preponderance of bone and cartilage, however.)

I had to wait a while to start eating, though, because I needed a fork and, surprise surprise, our waiter was nowhere to be found.

With service like this and food that's just barely passable, it's hard to envision returning.",1

After I tried, I can say that it's not the place you would die for, but I do recommend and would visit this place again because it's definitely bang for the buck. 

I tried their Margherita pizza, and three different pasta dishes including gnocchi (can't remember the names of the other two - 1 seafood, 1 mushrooms). I especially enjoyed gnocchi, and the other pastas were also good but a little salty for me. 

Overall, a good place for a casual night out and affordable price for good meals.",2
997,"Eataly is located in the Manulife building but it has its own entrance (you have to walk past the Manulife building entrance) to see the Eataly one. If you go in the Manulife entrance, it's like a wild goose chase trying to find Eataly - there's no signage or direction anywhere. 

In general, Eataly is a nice concept for all things italian. The items are a little on the pricier side and you can get most items elsewhere for cheaper. But as my friend said, it's the Eataly experience.

There are a few restaurants (reservations recommended), counter type food stations, desserts, coffee, a bar, and a grocery store with meats, cheese, olives etc. 

I also think a lot of the produce products will end up in the garbage - you can see them starting to turn bad. Not sure if there is a large enough market for those products. 

Overall, it was a nice place to visit but the experience was just okay. It can get crowded with people everywhere just browsing. The food was just okay (we ate at La Pizza and La Pasta, and had a cannoli and a tiramisu after). I feel like I've had better Italian Food elsewhere. 

Come for the hype once and then spend your $$ elsewhere.",1
609,"This restaurant is a go-to of mine that I can always count on. They serve up tried and true dishes that always taste delicious and are filled with flavour! 

Be aware, wait times can be pretty long at this spot. It is not uncommon to be told that you will have to wait 45 mins at the door. I suggest getting here before the dinner buzz comes in (and I promise it's worth it). The atmosphere is lively, the restaurant is industrial chic, and the service is impeccable. 

As most will note, the mafalde ai funghi is a must try. The truffle cream sauce is to die for. You can't go wrong with this signature dish. Another favourite of mine is the prosciutto e rucola. This pizza is the perfect blend of ingredients. And don't forget to share the burrata as a starter! This creamy delectable cheese will make you feel like you are truly in Italy.

This place is takeout only, there is no room to barely stand inside. Plan on eating in your car or sneaking a table in the food court.  You better not stutter when ordering because the cashier is all about fast efficient ordering.  
I'm giving a one star penalty because they don't offer duck in any of the combos. They only offer half duck minimum orders.  I was super bummed. I ended up ordering BBQ pork and soy sauce chicken with an absurd amount of green onions sauce. It sure hit the spot.  I was super jealous of my brother's roast pork order.  The skin was perfect. 10/10. The meat was so moist. For sure next time I'm going to order that.",2

Had the green curry with fish.   For $16 you get a ton of food.   Got about 5 pieces of delicious fish (Basa though, but I like the taste of Basa).   The fish is not over battered in its panko crust.    Fried to perfection and very juicy.  The curry sauce is so good which is served on the side.   I dipped the fish and poured some on my rice.   

Have to go back to try the Khao soi next time.   Can't wait to go back",2
906,"I reallyyyy wanted to like this place, I was truly excited to try it. 
The ambiance, the decor and the service were all great. But the food was just average for me. 

I really loved the caffè con zabaglione (espresso with sweet italian custard ) It was honestly the highlight of our meal. The Italian Custard gave it a wonderful sweet taste, similarly to how coffee with bailey's would taste. 

Unfortunately they didn't have many Gluten Free options or Vegetarian options, but we managed. 

I ordered the strapazzate dish (pulled mixed farm eggs, burrata & black truffles ) While to some it might seem like a delicate egg dish, to me, it tasted quite bland and lacked flavour. There was essentially no seasoning in the egg. All you tasted was plain egg with burrata cheese. 

I might come back here for a pastry and a coffee, but not for a meal",1
1327,"I was so excited to come here based on the number of reviews that said this was ""the best ramen in Toronto"". 

I was underwhelmed. The spicy red miso ramen had zero flavor and zero spice. 

Service was great and friendly. I joined the waitlist on Yelp while we were ubering from Union. By the time we got there we waited less than five minutes. 

You just put yourself on the waitlist and once you get there you check in with the host. They text you once your table is ready. Very efficient. 

But yeah. It was ok. I've had better ramen...",1
1883,"Stopped by on a Sunday for some dim sum, having visited previously ~6 years ago and recalling an enjoyable visit. Lai Wah Heen is on the second floor of an aging Doubletree Hotel in Chinatown. The hotel has seen better days, but the dining room is fine and clean, if dated. Our experience with the food on this visit was quite mediocre. While nothing was off putting, the flavor and quality were not a good as we had remembered, and certainly a far cry from our best dim sums in China/HK. Honestly, there were no clear highlights. Service was above average for a Chinese venue, i.e. you don't have to flag down a waitress, but nothing to write home about. While we are out-of-towners, believe there are probably better options for dim sum.",0
1809,"I am giving them five stars because I know how hard they work everyday and they produce good authentic Chinese food.

The service quality might upset some people, but it won't be too bad. The owners are very friendly, so make sure to choose the lamb peta",2
1783,"It looks really sketchy outside but don't like it scare u away, cuz the food is pretty good! Let's talk about the 4 dishes we ordered:

1. Dan dan noodles. Okay I'm pretty sure it is not the authentic dan dan noodles but the way they presented it was pretty smart. All the spicy sauce is on the bottom of the bowl because if u can't take that much spicy then u don't have to stir all into the noodles. But other than that no comments.
2. Chicken dry pot. We ordered this because other three plate wasn't enough. It came on a stove and a pot, it tastes amazing but the fire down the stove is just really concerning I wish they could use some protection around it.
3. Spicy beef. ITS SO GOOD and SO SPICY. I freakin loved it!! I'm not joking about the spicy level of this dish so if u can't really take real spicy u need to bring ice milk with u. Also u need to try the numbing pepper that Sichuan cuisine has, it will numb ur tongue and it is such a cool sensation.
4. Double cooked pork belly. It's extremely salty, like super duper salty. We had to order rice to eat this. 

The service: the waiters and waitresses hang around but they r really slow at services.",1
1713,This was just okay for me. There are so many hand pulled noodle places in Toronto now that I'm not sure this really stands out. They have generous noodle portions but not so many veggies. Meat was all right. I think my big mistake was getting the chicken wings which turned out being tasteless and with breading similar but (not as flavorful) as KFC. Oh well. On to the next place.,0
1693,Totally delicious (and fast!). We live in Chinatown and go out a lot and this is our new favourite spot.,2
1480,"Service was as ok, dumplings are ok (depends) place is kinda gross. 

If you're not picky then this place might have good dumplings for you, just ignore the poor cleanliness of the place then you're good! The plates they use look old, and I question the cleanliness of the stuff they use. I saw a pile of serving plates near the front where they're cooking and I couldn't figure out if it was the dirty pile or the clean pile.

Service is prompt, I've been here a couple of times. My first time was with my s.o., who is white. We pretty much got ignored most of the time, the only time they attended to us was to ask for our order and to pay. 

The second time was with my Chinese friend, she spoke in Mandarin to them and I noticed they actually filled up my water a couple of times, I have no idea if it's cause I went with her.

Now for the dumplings, my friend said that the wrapper they used was too thick for her liking, and she said it made sense since they used dough. I didn't mind but the filling of the dumpling had a gross bitterness to it, and this comes from someone that willingly eats bitter melon. The pan fried one tasted better, but near the end we got sick from eating it cause of the oil, it pooled at the bottom.

The first time I went here, I only got steamed dumplings, I got the mushroom and spinach one and it was tasty. My boyfriend got steamed pork dumplings and he didn't complain, although he seldom does. I definitely think it's a must try but you can only pay in cash so make sure you bring some. If you're with TD, you might need to trek a bit if you want an ATM, otherwise CIBC, RBC and Scotiabank clients are good since the ATMs are in close proximity",1
1535,"If you want cheap and authentic dumplings, this is THE place to go! I ran across this place on multiple sites when searching for places to eat in Toronto so expectations were very high. And the place did NOT disappoint! 

Food - absolutely delicious. Especially the soup dumplings. 11/10

Service - fast and accurate. 10/10

Interior - super packed. Very hard to actually get a table. But cute layout! 5/10

I ate at this place three times while on a 5 day trip to Toronto, which simply speaks to how good this place was! I'm convinced this place is packed regardless of the time of day. There was never an instance in which I walked into an empty or partially empty store. I would recommend just taking out from here since it's so packed! But definitely stop by in Toronto!!!",2
235,"I have been here a few years ago and not sure what changed in that time but the service yesterday (Sat - Oct 5) was pretty terrible. If it were only one thing I wouldn't really bother but every aspect left the three of us shaking our heads. 
- even after putting my name down an waiting for an hour, we never got the call that our table is ready. Upon walking in after an hour the hostess checked the iPad and just lead us to the table. No clarification about why we weren't called.
- the table wasn't really cleaned-up or arranged. We had to pick it up and move so my friend could get in and not hit the people sitting on the adjacent table.
- the server didn't show up got more than 10 minutes
- when he finally came to take our order, he only took drink order (we were ready to order the full meal as we had waited over an hour and then 10 mins more for the server). Then after a few more minutes the server came and took our food order. 
- Food arrived, but no silverware to eat (salad). And then when we were almost done eating, we had to remind the server about our drinks order (smh).
- Finally had to wait to get the bill and then to pay too. Almost wanted to just walk out really. 
Mind you when we got our table, the restaurant wasn't as busy as before.",0
656,"The food was enjoyable, the service was friendly, and the price was reasonable.

However, though my party of four were the only ones in the restaurant aside from another couple, it took very long for our food to come out. I can't imagine how long it would take if it was a full house.  Based on other reviews here, this seems like an ongoing problem at Agio.

The decor is also a mismatch to what they're trying to be... a restaurant that serves high end Italian cuisine. It's basically a hole in the wall here, well below average in all aspects (floor, tables, decor, walls, washrooms, etc)",1
436,"Excelente!!!!! I had a great experience at Xola, great service and great food. 100% authentic Mexican food and test. We ordered appetizer Trio, the Duck confit tacos and the Arrechera everything was awesome!!! I definitely will come back!",2
1377,"I came here for my birthday celebration. It was a surprise, so I was super excited when we stopped by this place. As we walked in, you walk up a very instagram-able set of stairs. We were greeted promptly, and offered coat-check.

We got a table by the live piano. The piano playing added a nice ambience to our dinner. But I found the piano a little bit too loud at times, so it was hard to hear my date talk. But I did enjoy how he would play to the age group of the crowd. I didn't enjoy my 'sofa seat' that much because it was too low for me to eat properly. It sank in a lot as well. 

Our server explained the menu to us, and recommend that we share a steak and order two to three sides. 

We ordered:
14oz Creekstone Farm Prime Black Angus rib eye - medium rare $91
Table Side Caesar Salad - $26 
Mushroom Risotto - $26
Duck Fat Fries - $17 

Each table started with their house made brioche - which was crispy on the outside and fluffy and hollow on the inside. It also came with their garlic butter, which was buttery goodness. 

Then came the Caesar Salad. The salad was more of a show where the severs would roll a cart of ingredients for the salad to your table and make it in front of you. It was a nice touch to see them make everything from scratch. The salad maker didn't really talk to us or try to make conversation so it was a little disappointing. (I saw the table next to us have a full on conversation with their salad maker).

The salad was good, but not the best caesar salad I ever had. It was a nice balance of cheese, and smoked bacon and a hint of anchovies. If you aren't the biggest fan of anchovies, you can ask for it on the side. I did find it a bit fishy at times. 

Next, came the steak, which was cooked to perfection. I've never had such a tender and perfectly cooked steak. It was charred on the outside on an iron skillet. The steak came with charcoal salt, herbed salt, and pink salt (super fancy). All the salts tasted the same, salty. The steak also came with a chimichurri sauce, blue cheese and yuzu shoyu. I enjoyed the blue cheese the most. The salts and the blue cheese, brought out the beef flavour. Hands down, this is one of the best steaks I've ever had.

The risotto was good as well. My date didn't enjoy it as much, but I didn't mind it. But, if given another opportunity, we probably would have gotten something else.

The duck fat fries were amazing. Who would have thought fries could be cooked this nicely. Every fry had a good ratio of crispiness and fluffiness. The fries came with two sauces, their house ketchup and a garlic mayo. 

We didn't get dessert, but the restaurant gives you a small tasting of their dessert free of charge. We got a small chocolate and a macaron. On the way out, they also give you chocolate muffins as a take-away. This was a nice touch.

Jacob's is definitely a fancier place. From the service, to the ambiance, decorations and even the bathroom, they make sure your visit is enjoyable. The server made sure to check up on us every so often, the water's were always filled, and our napkins were always folded if we left the seat. The elderly gentleman, at the entrance, even insisted in helping me wear my jacket  - even after I refused (I gave in). 

I would like to come back and try their other steaks. There is a Wagyu Steak that costs $880 - out of my price range, but this gives you an idea of the type / quality of steaks they have.",2
107,"Delicious Mexican food - though to be frankly honest, this was my first try eating authentically Mexican food not associated with any chain. The server was very friendly and cute, and upon entering the restaurant, the first thing we noticed was that everyone there spoke Spanish! We stook out like a sore thumb.

My sister had crazy cravings for burritos, and so she ordered their burrito ($10). While she didn't have any choices for fillings, she was able to choose the protein choice and ultimately selected the beef fajita (flank steak). A massive brick sized, densely stuffed burrito soon arrived. It was filled with seasoned rice (omg the rice was so good by itself - I believe it had been cooked in some broth and so was unbelievably flavourful and umami), refried beans, fatty and crispy seared flank steak, cabbage, corns, tomatoes, etc. It was then topped with sour cream. The burrito was really filling but so delicious! My sister was stuffed by the end of it but couldn't help herself spooning lots in her mouth.

I was really craving soup, and was torn between the consome (lamb with chickpea soup) and pozole (a red pork soup with hominy). In the end, the server recommended pozole, and so I ordered that (even though it was a solid $5 more expensive). The soup came filled to the brim with pork, and some chicken, as well as hominy. It was my first time eating hominy, and found its dense mushy texture to be very interesting. Before I seasoned the soup with any of the provided garnishes, I found the soup to strongly resemble a Chinese pork and bean soup that we make often. 

The pozole came with limes, radishes, onions, spicy red peppers, some thyme bits, tortilla chips, and a green salsa verde. After adding the lime, onions, and salsa, the soup's flavours were all accentuated and enriched. It was absolutely delicious! I only wish that there were less hominies and more broth...

Overall, a very satisfying and deliciously authentic Mexican meal! Highly recommend.",2
1446,"A solid china town find. The food is plentiful, delicious and worth it. I love eating their specials because they have great appetizers, soups, teas and set menus. It's pretty cheap for how much you get. I can't describe what Hong Kong style food It's a mix of British influenced Asian food. I always go for spaghetti!",2
473,"Had a great time here! Yes, like everyone else agrees, the ambiance is 5++. See photos. 

The food is actually quite on point too! My friend who is from Mexico City felt this was very tasty and plans to take her parents here when they come visit from Mexico. Got the guac (fresh they mix it at the table), ceviche trio (refreshing! Good quality seafood and nice flavor combinations), two types of tacos, and the elote which was surprisingly amazing (nothing like the sad mayo based stuff you get on the street). Want to try the deserts but we were too full! 

Service was wonderful too. We got there at 7pm on a Saturday. 1 hour wait for the patio. We went to the bar to get drinks and appetizers and they let us bring our apps outside when our table was ready. Yes we were a little annoying but the girl at the front was very accommodating. Waiter was very attentive and kind :), gave good recommendations.",2
1751,"Worst Chinese food ever. It's places like this that give Chinese food a bad name. Threw out 75% of our order. 

Ordered what I thought would be staple Cantonese dishes that any decent place would find hard to screw up. Well guess what, Ha Gow managed to do just that. The seafood fried noodles were capital B bland - would it have hurt them to put even one drop of soy sauce? They also used cheap shrimp and squid that had no flavour. We also ordered the fried shrimp with spicy salt. This is honestly the most basic Cantonese dish (equivalent to fries for a Canadian restaurant). Well what came were those cheap shrimps they used for the noodles but smothered in a thick batter (they looked like balls of grease). Each bite oozed with grease and didn't taste like shrimp at all.

The other dishes ordered were equally bad. Seafood dumpling (all it tasted of was MSG), steamed squid in ginger and onion (think rubber bands laced with MSG), and shrimp rolls (no flavour). The spinach & shrimp dumpling was the only thing decent item. 

Avoid, avoid, avoid.",0
1694,"Very bad service the servers are so loud and rude .. the food tastes bad and super oily, the chicken is not white meat while they told me it was , the rice had rocks in it that almost broke my tooth and so not clean the whole experience was so bad I wouldn't recommend anyone to go there and on top of that I went back home with food poison and had diarreah .. the worst place ever please watch out",0
1833,"The barbecue meat here is really good, juicy and tender. I normally get the lunch boxes here, and it's very hit and miss here.
I made the mistake of coming here 1.5 hours before they closed. They ran out of veggies, but still had plenty of meat left.

If you get the young dude cutting your meat, you're gonna get much less meat in your box. he's pretty stingy. and I've gone here 3 times, and every time he cut my meat, I got either bad cuts, or very little.

I've gotten roasted duck rice before, and he gives you the bones and rib area, with one piece of breast so you have one piece with meat.

Today I got 2 boxes, No veggies were left. I got 6 pieces of bbq pork and 5 pieces of roasted pork. and whole box load of rice. was so disappointed! barely any toppings, and they had plenty of meat left!! not like they were running out.

argh! the only part I can't complain is it's 6.50 a box and comes with either soup or a can of pop.

Pro tip, come early, otherwise don't come. and hope it's not the young dude cutting your meat.",1
257,"This place is a very busy spot downtown and it's the type of place you come and go or take it to go because of how tight the space is. I got the 3 type plate and they're okay. They're not bad but not amazing either (bear in mind, I eat a lot of tacos). Definitely worth trying out if you're already in the area but would I take an hr TTC ride to come here again? Nope.",1
1501,"Fairly average Chinese food but open late until 2:00 am with lots of seating. They are located a block or so from from Spadina on Dundas.

Their food seems pretty average to me except for their char siu (BBQ Pork) on rice that is my favorite. Everything else is ok but with the exception of great wok hei. If you're looking for a quick bite after a night out this place will do since they open until 2:00 am and has plenty of seating. Their menu is fairly intense about 500 items and with plenty of seating for a big group. 

The food comes out super fast piping hot. Service is ok just need to keep flagging someone down, their table turn over is quick that is the way they operate so don't expect stellar service but they aren't horrible either.",1
647,"We came here (King St location) Tuesday evening to take our guests from Vancouver to a nice dinner. Buca has been my favorite Italian spots in Toronto and has been my top recommendation for good restaurants in the city. We never once had a negative experience at Buca until last night. It was very disappointing to be in such a classy restaurant only to be treated poorly by their servers. We ordered charcuterie and pasta amongst the 5 of us. As we finished our dinner, we had told our server to pack up my bigoli pasta. As I picked up my takeout box, I realized it was not what I ordered. I quickly told the server that this was not mine and to my surprise, she yelled ""f*** off"" and stormed off in the kitchen. We were in shock as to why she responded this way. She returned shortly after, visibly disgruntled, and told me to stay put while the manager comes to talk to me. The manager arrives and simply tells me to wait while they make a new one for me to take home. She was not apologetic at all. Mind you, we had to wait 30 minutes for them to make the pasta again and as soon as I received it, they did not even acknowledge the fact that it shouldn't have taken that long. 

Mistakes happen but under no circumstances should servers be swearing at their customers. We are extremely confused as to what led to such aggresive remarks when we were the ones who had to wait 30 minutes to get our takeout. Definitely not going back after this incident. Servers were rude and ruined our evening.",0
1520,"If I was able to give 0 stars, I would. This is probably the worst restaurant I've eaten at. 

We ordered 5 dishes, 4 of which were completely inedible.
- Traditional pancake: This was our first dish and was fairly tasty. No complaints here. This was the only redeeming part of the experience.
- Green beans with minced meat: It was too salty and too oily. 
- Kungpow shrimp: This is absurdly greasy and spicy which left our tongues numb. 
- Fried rice with pineapple and seafood: In contrast to the previous two dishes that were over-spiced, this was tasteless and (surprise surprise) oily as heck. 
- Lobster with ginger and scallion: This was the most pathetic dish of them all. We were served either a baby lobster that had not yet developed any meat, or they somehow threw out half of the lobster before plating it. On top of this, it did not taste fresh.

Sometimes terrible food can be saved by good service. Nope, not today unfortunately. The waiters were amateur (pleasant, and well-meaning but did not know what they were doing). They gave us a dirty fork, and when we alerted them to it, they took it away then brought it back and said ""we washed it for you"". 

You might look at my profile picture and judge me for being a clueless white guy. I went with a group of 3 other Chinese people who know food well, and we were all appalled at how this restaurant is even open for business.",0
1161,"Dimmi was ok but it wasn't anything special. My husband, daughter and I were in Toronto for a quick family vacation. After sight seeing we went to Yorkville to shop. Of course all of the shopping made us hungry. We walked up and down the street to find something to eat. We finally decided on Dimmi. I had a taste for pasta and thought this would be a good choice. It was pretty busy but there was no wait. The staff was very nice and accommodating.

When we first got there my husband and I ordered drinks. He got a Old-Fashioned and I got a Sangria. He enjoyed his drink. My drink started off good but then started to taste like medicine the more I drank it. Needless to say I didn't finish it.

We started our dinner with ordering the Kale as an appetizer. Of course this was a side salad. It consisted of shaved kale with pinenuts and cranberries covered with pecorino cheese in a lemon and olive oil dressing. This salad was very good. The flavors were nice and most of all I enjoyed the pinenuts. They added a nice crunch to the dish. 

For our entrees I ordered the STRO ZZAPRETI ALLA ERNESTO and my husband ordered the Roasted Chicken Breast. My dish consisted of spicy nduja sausage, rapini and cherry tomatoes in garlic and olive oil. This was something different for me but good. The sausage added a nice hint of heat but not too spicy. The pasta was good. It also had cherry tomatoes and spinach. I could have done without the spinach. I like spinach in salads or creamed spinach but I don't like plain cooked down spinach. The texture is odd in my opinion. Other than that this dish was good.  My husband's dish came with vegetables and roasted potatoes. The chicken was pretty tender but flavorless. The whole plate was flavorless for that matter. It was very bland and needed seasoning. My husband ate it but he wasn't thrilled. 

Last, we ended our meal with a dessert. We ordered the Apple Crumble. It came out in a slice but instead of pie crust topping it had a crumble topping. It came with a scoop of ice cream. This dish was decent. It was pretty tasty. It's one of those things that is wasn't bad but it wasn't the best we have had. 

Overall, Dimmi was ok. We enjoyed it but it wasn't anything special.",1
1475,"This place has great dumplings (especially their pan fried ones, pork and chive is my fave), but there was one time when I went, maybe almost 2 years ago that really pissed me off. I would be more inclined to give this place 4 stars if it weren't for poor customer treatment. 

It was busy in the restaurant and a line was forming. My friend and I had just finished our meal. I had ordered a soy milk and was finishing it while also trying to buy tickets for a movie on my phone. I was aware that there was a lineup and I was trying to hurry but not chug my drink, but I was still finishing so I didn't think it would be an issue. One of the older ladies who runs the restaurant (in Chinese we would call her the 'lao ban niang') complained loudly and angrily to her staff in Chinese that I was playing on my phone and ordered them to clean our table up in an effort to get us to leave. It doesn't sound too bad when I type it out but it's just different in Chinese and her tone was angry. Only my mom talks to me like that when she's scolding me. I was very annoyed when I heard this, but finished my drink and got up to leave. The same woman put on a fake smile and said ""thank you!"" as we walked out the door. 

In this case, she probably didn't think I would understand her, which is probably also why she said what she said, but it really ruined my meal. Unfortunately for her, I understood every word. I hope they will exercise more caution when talking about customers in Chinese. I am Asian so I am used to less than ideal service at some mom and pop restaurants so I am understanding of most service at Chinese restaurants but I also don't like being scolded behind my back, and then treated so drastically different to my face.

In that moment I dramatically vowed never to return but the dumplings are too good and I have since returned and had pleasant experiences.

I mean, I doubt the woman even remembers that this happened but it was a bad enough experience that I felt compelled to write about it so long after, but the food is still good and I would recommend this place to people who don't mind feeling rushed when they eat. 

I like the potato threads and shanghai noodles in addition to boiled and pan fried dumplings.",1
1877,"Lai Wah Heen used to be the best luxury dim sum restaurant in downtown Toronto. Overtime, the quality of the restaurant declined. While services and atmosphere still remain the same, quality and price are no longer on par. 

Out of the four items my brother and I shared, the best item was fried bean curd sheet with mushrooms served with aged balsamic vinegar ($5). It was crispy and juicy. Truffle Snow pea vegetarian wrap was unfortunately subpar ($5.5). The snow pea is not picked and over-steamed. 

With that said, it may still be a good option if you are a downtown dweller. However, I would not recommend Lai Wah Heen if you have access to dim sum restaurants in uptown Markham and Richmond Hill.",1
560,"I was on the street car when I noticed King's Tacos. I was curious so I went in for a bite. I was expecting a fast food restaurant like Taco Bells, but it was a sit down restaurant. King's Tacos decor was plainly decorated in a casual restaurant style. The service was okay, but you have to pay at the front.

The service started with the waitress bringing little bowls of sauce and onions. I am not familiar with Mexican food or tacos. I ordered the Arrachera taco which is made of beef fillets. I added the ingredients and sauces to the tacos to add flavours. I thought that the tacos were okay.

Would I go back? Maybe to try the other tacos. But I am not familiar with Mexican cuisine so it is hard to evaluate the food.",1
1008,"We ate at the Le Pizza La Pasta restaurant. 

I would have given this place 4/5 if it weren't for what happened with our billing/menu.

We came in on a Tuesday night. Put our name in and had a walk around for 40-45 minutes. Overall the food was good. We ordered a pasta and a pizza along with the Burutta as an appetizer. The bread came with some really tasty olive oil. The pizza was excellent with generous toppings. I found our pasta good but not great. 

WHAT WENT WRONG: The menu had the Burutta for $8. When the receipt came - I did a quick glance and paid the bill. However the total came up higher than I thought it would be I went back to look at the receipt. The Burutta showed up as $18. I did a double take on a new menu from the front desk to make sure it said $8. My server was elsewhere by now. I went to the front to ask the hostess who at this point basically dismissed me with a chuckle that the menu was ""printed wrong"". I was in a rush so left but I would have definitely taken this up with the manager.

I really think they should have just fixed their menu (even just pencilled it in), or warned me it was a pricing error when I ordered.",0
1023,"Heard this joke while I was at Nodo - Why are a lot of Italian men named Tony? Because when they migrated over to the states, they wore name tags To NY.

This is a cute cozy restaurant with great food and service.  I came for dinner with a group of 6 and had a great time.  There are many great options on the menu including soup, pizza, calzone, mussels, octopus, rigatoni, and gnocchi.  Complimentary bread was brought out with olive oil after we ordered.  The food took a while to come out, but it was delicious.  

Arancini $9 - These were more like rice cones, crunchy on the outside and cheesy on the inside.
Pappardelle $19 - This duck ragu ribbon pasta dish was excellent.  The meat was like pulled duck, flavorful and tender.  The sauce went really well without everything.

Street parking on Dundas is free on weekdays after 6p.  I was able to find a spot across the street when I am for dinner on a Wednesday night.  There are also paid parking lots nearby.

12,"My friend and I decided on Mexican food for dinner and this popped up as nearby where we were at the time, Yorkville/Annex area. As we walked in, immediately we're greeted and seated in a tight space for 2. The menu was explained to us and water was given, then we were left for a few minutes to decide. 

We decided on salsa fresca & chips, chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas along with a bottle each of corona and negra cervezas.

Salsa fresca and chips arrived first, the tomato salsa was delicious, the morita chile seemed to have been grilled before it was mashed together with tomatoes and red onions and went well with the crispy chips. (If you come for anything at all, this would be it and definitely skip the guac as it didn't seem appetizing.)

My friend and I shared the chicken enchiladas suizas and short rib emmoladas, while tasty, I could've gotten it somewhere else for cheaper. 

Because of how tight the space is, I was able to look around at what the other dinners ordered and the the tacos seemed to be more popular, so will have to come back and try those.

We also ordered alfajores, which at $8 for 2 was just meh.",1
1773,"I brought my dad, stepmom and half siblings here for dinner as they were visiting from Vietnam and craving some Chinese food and I wanted to take them somewhere classier than the Chinatown restaurants.  BIG MISTAKE.  You can take a girl out of Chinatown, but you CAN'T take the Chinatown out of a girl!!! The service was not good. 

First of all, for the area and price point, I expected to be able to ask the servers about the menu but apparently they don't know why is popular or well-liked. Secondly, my dad and stepmom had a quiet hushed disagreement and the server near us started giving them dirty looks. Everything else was based on lack experience from the servers. Appetizers coming out at the end of the meal, lack of napkins despite having three kids at the table, failure to clear emptied dishes.  

The food was pretty good. While it could not make up for the poor service, I would order takeout from them but I will not dine in again unless there are extenuating circumstances.",1
1620,"Another example of ""don't judge a book by its cover."" Yummy Yummy may look slightly run down with its bland looks but the food and service definitely belies its otherwise plain (and dare I say somewhat sketchy?) looks. 

First of all, the owner of Yummy Yummy is a really nice lady. She helped pick out items for us when we were having a hard time deciding. It was like having a friend's mom cook for us! 

The food itself was authentic and tasted like it was made at home. I really enjoyed the xiao long bao and the potato salad. Pricing was cheap too! 

We ended up coming back a second time and will be down for coming back a third time. This place is a must-visit!",2
1460,"The interior here is spacious and clean, which makes it a good place for happy hour or business meals. The servers were quick, but it took some effort to get their attention sometimes. 

We had the dan dan noodles, pork belly over rice, XLB, and pan fried dumplings. Although this was a mix of appetizers and dimsum, the amount of food was just enough for us. My favorite was the dan dan noodles, especially with the hot chili oil for those that like spice. 

Overall I had a good dining experience but was a bit disappointed with the dimsum selection. I was looking for a good dimsum restaurant in Chinatown and, for being labeled a dimsum restaurant, there wasn't that much.",1
263,"Came here for the first time by luck, on a Tuesday- had to take advantage of their Taco Tuesday special ($28 for 8 hardshell tacos). 

The service here was friendly but a little slower than normal standards. It is also pretty stuffy inside on a hot day, especially on the top floor, but the restaurant itself is a cute, grungy setup. 

I shared the special with my friend, and it came with the perfect amount of toppings to fill the tacos... it's always so satisfying when you're giving the perfect food ratios. The tacos are presented on a tray along with the (""sides"" is what they call it but I think a better word for it is just the taco stuffings). It came with all your taco essentials, including guac. The ground beef also had a bit of a spicy kick to it, and the taco shells had a different crunch to them. Overall, nothing was mind blowing about the tacos. I think it's fun for when you're coming in a pair with someone else, but you'd need to order more with it to fully fill up an empty stomach (good thing my friend and I had a snack before coming). The tacos were presented nicely but if I were to get this for say, takeout, not sure the deal is worth hyping about. 

I'd be open to coming back to try more of their extravagant tacos though :) judging from their menu the prices seemed reasonable for a downtown restaurant.",1

As aways they didn't disappoint me. I had the Stone Bowl Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen and my friend had the Garlic Shoyu Ramen and to finish off I got the Mochi for the first time as a dessert. Stone Bowl Shoyu Kotteri Tsukemen was unique! Its cold noodle and you dip the cold noodle into the hot pot! Highly recommend it!",2
144,"El Trompo has always flown over my head - I've walked by a hundred times but never noticed it. I'm happy I finally did, because the tacos here are amazing! These tacos are more ""street"" than Seven Lives', but there's definitely a time and place for them

While the tacos here are great, I was incredibly disappointed that the chips + pico I ordered to start seemed to be store-bought tortilla chips - they reminded me of Tostitos. The pico was pre-made, and super cold out  of the fridge, another disappointment. Plus, service is spotty.",1
102,"Unfortunately, Hacienda las Americas didn't live up to the hype. My wife and I went here for dinner and got:
- Guacamole and chips: Guac was surprisingly bland and chips tasted store-bought.
- Sopes: This looked like a thick tortilla with lots of meat and veggies on it. It was 3 for $12, which we thought was a pretty good deal so got 6. The standout was the chorizo (super tasty and great bite). The chicken, beef suadero, beef sirloin, and beef tongue were pretty standard-to-good. The carnitas was too stringy and a little tough for me.

Maybe I'm in the (Yelp) minority and wasn't blown away with this place because I didn't get the tacos... but they were using the same meats for the tacos as the sopes, so I'm doubtful I'd have a different review. Worth a try once, but won't be back.",1
548,"We went with my children to this restaurant and the service was good but the food was mediocre and heavily priced for the value. I ordered a cheese melt, and got more sausage than cheese and the cheese was cheddar (this dish is not done with cheddar). For $40 dollars per person without alcoholic beverages, one would expect so much more. It was 7 pm and the place was empty. Very disappointed. We won't go back!",0
357,"I think this is between a 3 and a 4.  I enjoyed the tacos,   the chicken one was really very tasty.  But what a mess to eat,  the wrap was very soft and fell apart but it all had a wonderful taste,   lots of flavours.

I had the melted cheese starter with chorizo,  it was ok.  I personally don't like the corn wrap they make here.   They are thick and heavy and really doesn't add anything to the cheese dip.    We had the chips and dip to start with.   There was were some very nice dips here from chillies and guacamole too.   The chips are quite salty though, be warned.   We also had a tasty citrus drink,  grapefruit based,  this was very nice,  we both enjoyed this.   We ended with the churros which were very nice.  Sweet cinammon sugar on top,   very yummy. 

On the whole it was good and alright mixed together.   But also isn't cheap.   I think it cost us $70 for food and two sodas,",1
81,"Ok, so I know this place is all the rage. 

I ordered the grilled beef for corona takeaway and I was disgusted. There was more fat, cartilage and inedible pieces than beef. Chew chew CRUNCH - spit. Over and over. My friend called me two hours later after ordering the same thing - she ended up giving her order to the homeless after the first bite. 

This means that they either don't clean (cut the meat) properly, or using cheaper pieces to save a buck. 

The grilled chicken was dry too. Honestly though, the shrimp was good. Stick to pulled beef and chicken for authenticity and - TEXTURE. C'mon seven lives!

Very disappointed.",0
1763,"Dynasty is a decent spot if you're looking for Chinese food in the area. The place is nice inside (given its location in Yorkville), and the food selection is quite typical - similar to those found in other Cantonese restaurants. Nothing out of the ordinary. They offer an evening dim sum menu (a slightly condensed version of the regular dim sum selection). Service is pretty good and food comes out quick.",1
627,"It's in yorkville and it has a cool name so it must be good, right? Right! Only, it doesn't get any better than good. Took my sis for her bday and was so shocked at how basic the flavours were. My mom got the four cheese spaghetti-- it was drippy n barely had taste. Mine was 7/10--a chicken dish, sister said her pasta was ""more wet than buttery"". The best part about this place was the beautiful interior and great service. I wish I liked the food more bcoz everyone seemed so nice.",1
1281,"A truly elevated dining experience! I'd say the food above all. Quality is impeccable. The dumplings are an absolute must have. Stuffed with creamy eggplant in a heavenly yoghurt sauce. The meats were also done just right, lamb being so tender and not gamey at all, not salty, the flavors subtle and well balanced. Had an old fashioned with hints of coffee and of course a real big ice cube. Decor is classy but nothing special, was hoping for something more unique but the food makes up for it all.

Warning: it is expensive so be prepared to spend around 80-100$ per person if you get drinks.",2
980,"My review is for Uber eats delivery from Grazie.

773,"My friend and I came here for her bday. We went during the day time as it gets pretty packed during the night time. The ambience is nice and fancy but still casual. Keep in mind you're probably going to be seated really close to another table.

I ordered the Quattro Stagioni pizza. It was okay, I expected better it tasted kinda basic especially for the price.

My friend, I believe ordered Taiatelle all's Bolognese. I tried some and it had good flavour but nothing amazing.

Also, we got the calamari to share which was really good!

Overall my experience was good. I just wouldn't go back again, there are so many other Italians restaurants that are better.",2
1069,"I went here years ago for winterlicious because of the great reviews. I was so unimpressed and felt like it was like any other restaurant that I vowed never to come back. Fast forward to recently, my friends wanted to catch dinner before a movie and decided on this place. I was hesitant but went anyways and absolutely loved it! We ordered the pizza, a couple of the salads and some cocktails. LOVED all the cocktails....they were strong and didn't taste it, just the way I like it! The pizza was huge, filling and made very well. Chewy and not overwhelming in flavour. The salads were all fantastic! The Parmesan cheese is to die for. Our waiter was also so charming and funny. He really made our night....p.s. dim lit atmosphere with a picture of the godfather. Loved it!",2

Shared a soppressata and funghi pizza with a glass of Aperol Spritz. Both pizza options were delicious. Not your typical thin crust, wood oven pizza but something thicker and softer in texture to consume.

Impeccable service as always.",2
1580,"I walk by Hotopia most days on my way home from work, and if you've ever passed by, you've probably smelled that strongggg spicy spice from outside. Maybe just walking by has even cleared your sinuses. It's been packed (usually with a line up) most nights when I've passed by which is why I've waited so long to check it out, but a few friends and I finally made our way here for dinner this past Sunday. I put my name on the Yelp waitlist for five people for 6pm, which turned out to be unnecessary as there were several empty tables when we arrived. (The restaurant got busy later around 7pm, and there were a few groups waiting for tables).

We have varying levels of spice tolerance between the five of us, so we ordered three dishes to share: pea sprouts in broth, steamed chicken with chili sauce, and the Sichuan pepper numb basa. The pea sprouts were the only non-spicy dish we ordered, and it was pretty standard as far as Chinese pea sprout dishes go (including the high price point). The steamed chicken wasn't too spicy and quite oily - watch out for the bones! The Sichuan pepper numb basa was the main dish that we ate with rice - it's definitely spicy, but not too numbing (as long as you avoid actually eating the peppercorns themselves, which I definitely did). There were quite a lot of pieces of basa as well as eggplant, and despite sweating and turning red from the spice, we found ourselves finishing everything. 

Service is pretty friendly, and they were fast to fill up our water (which we definitely needed). The bill came to ~$14 per person which was pretty decent for such a filling meal. This isn't my favorite type of Chinese cuisine as I'll admit, I can't really handle the heat. But I'm definitely interested in coming back to try some other dishes!",1
1312,"Bang bang bang. This place was actually kinda hard to find without the GPS. There was nothing really indicating that was the ice cream shop besides the light banner that says ice cream but I wasn't sure if I was at Bang Bang ice cream if that makes sense. 

But regardless the ice cream was pretty good. I don't think it blew me away because I've had alot of good ice cream but I will say all of the flavors were really unique. I got the lychee rosewater and it was amazing. It was lychee ice cream with raspberry flavors swirled in it. I also sampled the totaro and I will say the taro ice cream was definitely something I would come back and get",2

La chilaca taqueria is small taco shop serving delicious morsels for a great price!  Selling 3-5$ tacos and certain specials (like 10$ for 4 pastor tacos). 

I ordered the carne, pastor, carnitas, pollo, and fish. I only wish I didn't get full so fast because I wanted more. Probably the closest thing I've tasted to tacos on the street in Mexico. 

Would highly recommend the fish ( very fresh and light) and the pastor (if you're a fan of pineapples) and if not go for the pork.",2
185,"The service was amazing, the guy that greeted us especially was very enthusiastic. But .. when it came from the food. it was definitely 1/5. No flavour , no seasoning no nothing. We ordered 6 Tacos, Guac and chips and cheese Pupusas . To begin with the tacos lets just say we didn't eat them all. The shrimp tasted too.. fishy? not enough toppings on the taco. The beef was blend and so was the chicken. Only good thing about our order was the guac and chips. I normally go to taco Gus at Kensington (highly recommend ) and I regret trying something new.",0
1200,"Went on a Sunday night and there was already a line. We got a table for two within five minutes. For a Thai restaurant, I would have to say this place has an unusual ambience -- it's dimly lit with popular North American songs blasting on speakers throughout the restaurant, and can be quite loud. There is also a full bar here if that's your thing.

All in all, the food was great. The Gaeng Kiaw Wan 'In a Coconut' is a green curry dish served with rice and extra green curry in a bowl on the side (the waiter said it was because it can't all fit in the coconut). It is a dish more on the spicy side, but I would say it's still manageable. The coconut really gives this dish some character, and you can also scoop out some coconut meat with your spoon to eat as well. You can choose between chicken, beef, dish, or tofu & veggies.

Khao Soi is also a curry dish but it is a coconut curry dish. It is more sweet than spicy but still has a kick of spice to it. I like the combination of egg noodles and crunchy noodles. We got braised beef chunks (like the ones you put in beef stew), but you can choose between chicken or beef. I thought this dish might be overhyped when I was reading Yelp reviews prior to coming here, but it really is worth the hype.

Highly recommend this place for anyone looking to have Thai food in Toronto. I'll definitely be back again.",2
1724,"I love eating here on my comfort food/cheat days.

They have classic Hong Kong style soup noodles and bbq rice dish.  The noodles are made to order.  They have rice noodles, thick noodles, egg noodles to choose from.  Toppings include beef balls, fish balls, bbq pork, shrimp wonton, prom wonton, chicken, lemongrass chicken, beef stew, and others.  Better yet you can pick and choose.  You can get additional toppings like half size wonton, tofu, or beef sauce to add-on.  You can also pick just broccoli or bak choy.

You can pick rice dish too.

There is vegetarian options.

Their soy bean drink is small but tasty.

Staff is nice and friendly.

Line is long but service is fast.",1
334,"Ordered take out on a Saturday evening; Chicken Wings ($12.99), Burrito De Carne Asada ($12.99), and the Quesadillas De Tinga ($8.99). Staff were not overly friendly, ignoring me upon entry, servicing a walk-in couple before me, and assuming I was a food delivery courier.... The portions were all small, especially the SIX wings, yes only 6, which tasted OK. The burrito was one of the worst I've had in the city, lacking any flavour, and the Quesadillas was average. The sour cream that came with the Quesadillas was also questionable as it tasted, and had the consistency of being watered down. At a $25 price point this meal might have garnered 3 stars.

I will never return.

Aside: I noticed they charge $8.50 for pints which I thought was pricey. For reference The Keg charges the same price their craft beer selection.",0
1871,"Located on the second floor of DoubleTree By Hilton hotel is Lai Wah Heen, a premium dim sum restaurant. The restaurant is clean and elegant with original Chinese calligraphy paintings. I have dined here for dim sum on a few occasions, and have enjoyed it each time. However, most recently, I finally tried their dinner menu. It contains a variety of classic dishes and some more imaginative items. They are also now serving casserole dishes. 

Got the Casserole of Lobster, which was a very flavourful dish containing a healthy chunk of lobster, and vermicelli cooked in conpoy chili sauce. The XOXO added a nice spicy kick to it. That was my favorite dish of the night. They also have classic clay pot dishes. I wasn't a fan of the eel one (a little salty), but I enjoyed the chicken and foie gras & minced beef ones. They're priced for four people, so definitely good for friends or family to share. 

Since it's upscale, prices are higher than the average Chinese restaurants. So, I think people need to go in with an open mind that the price is not the same as most of the places in Chinatown or Markham. Overall, what I like about Lai Wah Heen is the consistency of the dim sum dishes and creativity (while remaining tasty).",2
1365,"Food: 
Have dined several times at Miku and the restaurant always delivers on a strong note. Dishes are well presented in a simple and elegant manner, and the desired flavour profiles are never hidden. 

Have ordered the nine piece nigiri plate on several occasions. The paired sauces and garnishes are excellent while each piece is masterfully crafted. Personally, I also enjoy the pressed oyshi sushi, which is torched to caramelize the top layer. The sushi is also layered, which provides an optimal fish to rice ratio and creates a nice harmony of gentle acidity from the rice, fused with umami and sweetness from the fish. 

For dessert, the Green Opera ranks among my favourite, if not, my sole favourite dessert in the city. The dessert features layers of génoise, chocolate ganache, sugar twill, hazelnut wafer, and green tea ice cream. The delectable finish always lives up to its name and provides a memorable experience that can cause even the most stringent calorie counter to transgress.

Atmosphere: 
Very spacious for a Japanese restaurant, which ensures a relatively high level of privacy and consequently is frequented by a more corporate crowd. Decor is as expected and layout of the restaurant offers something for everyone.

Service:
On point and as expected for a restaurant at this price level. Servers are descriptive and articulate in the knowledge of their dishes. Always satisfied with the level of service here.",2
191,"I came here on a bustling evening 30 mins before close(we hadn't realized they closed earlier than most restaurants in Korea town), however we weren't the last to walk through the doors. 

Since the restaurant is on the smaller side, we had to wait about 20 minutes before being seated. Even though they were close to closing, they didn't rush us at all.

The atmosphere is very cozy, laidback yet still lively. The service was great, our server was super outgoing and humorous which is nice after a long day at work. Food is very affordable, they have many options but not too many it becomes overwhelming. 


I ordered the chorizo and the pork soft taco, and all I can say is it brought me back to my trip in Mexico. The meat was juicy and the toppings were fresh. I also ordered the rice with cheese, although simple was great. 
We ordered plantains as well, and that was the icing on the cake to us. Instantly made me want to go back to Mexico. 

Would definitely come back, just wish they were open a little later.",2
43,"Rating: 3/5

Summary: 
We believe this restaurant is worth a visit if in the area. We have frequented this place multiple times and there is a reason we keep coming back. The service is extremely friendly and the atmosphere, though tight, is rather warm and welcoming. However, one must be careful when picking their dish because while some taste wonderfully flavorful, others are somewhat disappointing.

The dishes we tried: 
- burrito w/ verde sauce
- fish tacos
- chicken enchiladas
- chicken mole
- guac/salsa w/ chips
- mains circa $12-15
- appetizers circa $6-8

Food:
One of our favorite dishes is the Burrito with Verde Sauce. It's a big hot burrito packed with many flavors. What makes it special, however, is the verde sauce that complements the burrito very well. The verde sauce is a tangy and spicy sauce that consists of tomatillos, jalapenos, and lime. You probably won't get burritos smothered with a delicious sauce at other places where you'd think of getting a burrito (Chipotle, etc.). We'd also point out that the Guacamole tastes extremely fresh with a great rich and creamy feel. The chunky and spicy salsa is also great. The two dipping sauces pair well with the tortilla chips and is worth considering if looking for an appetizer.

However, we were disappointed with some of the dishes we ordered. For example, the enchiladas and chicken mole did not satisfy at all. As for the enchiladas, the ones we had were filled with extremely dry chicken and the wrap itself was also unappetizing.

On a positive note, the service is remarkable. The owner once even gave us a free refill for our horchata (a most delightful sweet drink consisting of rice, vanilla, and cinnamon). The servers are very kind and patient, thus contributing to a better dining experience.

Conclusion: 
Google reviews rates this as a 4.5/5. We give it a 3/5. It's worth a visit if in the area, but there are only certain dishes worth eating. We recommend the chicken or burrito with verde sauce and the horchata.

121,"After reading that they make their tortillas in- house, I was excited to come here for some tacos. For lunch, I ordered the chamberete (beef shank) and pescado (haddock). ""S"" on the menu indicates the taco is spicy. Since I have low heat/spice tolerance, I asked if they could make it mild. 

The tacos were smaller than other taco joints, but they are cheaper in price ($3.75 vs. $5-8). The tortilla was thin and soft yet it was still able to hold the filling/topping.

In terms of flavours and the protein, I didn't find it too memorable. The beef shank was a bit dry but the haddock was freshly fried.

Whilst sitting at the bar waiting for my food, I noticed that the staff worked like a well-oiled team!",1

525,"THIS PLACE IS PHENOMENAL!!!!

Everything from the customer service to the delicious food. I ordered two chicken Puebla tacos  and two carnitas tacos. They were fresh, tasty, and hit all the right flavours. Simple and authentic tacos which heavily focused on good quality meat with minimal filler other than some fresh pico and/or pickled onions (this is how tacos are supposed to be). I came back about 20 minutes later and ordered 4 more tacos because they're were literally THAT good. 

Please check this place out. These guys are legit! The dude wearing the supreme hat was super nice and knowledgeable about the food he was serving. I will definitely be going back very very soon. And I have honestly told everyone about this little place. A solid 10/10. I heard they do catering! Check this place out for sure if you're ever in the downtown area around Ryerson. La Marquesita is a hidden gem!",2
586,"Not impressed. I really wanted to like this place. From the reviews it seemed like this was a hidden gem type of place bit all I found there was mediocre overpriced food and indifferent service.
Had the queso fundido which was decent but not great, not hot enough so the cheese was already hardening up, chorizo was bland, also a small portion with only four tortillas for twelve dollars.
The elotes were ok, nothing special. One cob cut in thirds.
The tacos though were really disappointing. Had a fish, a calamari, and a cactus. Three for fifteen dollars was the deal. The fish and calamari were tiny nuggets of tasteless breaded frozen seafood, the nopales tasted like they were straight out of a can. They were all bizarrely garnished with two cucumber half-moons, the fish was garnished with the usual cabbage slaw. 
The two salsas provided were the best part of the meal.
The service was inattentive at best, water was never refilled, waiters were wandering around aimlessly with salsas and dishes, not knowing where they were going. Never were asked how the food was or if we needed anything.
Not a negative experience per se but not one that I care to experience again.",1
155,Their margaritas are excellent but their tacos aren't as good as they used to be. They are very simple - which isn't a bad thing *if* the few ingredients used standout and are prepared well. The pork was dry and the overall taco was flat - it didn't have the bright acidic flavours or freshness that I love in a taco.  The fish was tender but the chipotle sauce was overwhelming and I couldn't taste much beyond that. The queso fundido with mushrooms and onions was delicious and flavourful - it reminded me of French Onion soup. This place used to have delicious tacos years ago- hopefully I feel the same way about it soon.,1
877,"The burrata pizza from Buca is AMAZING! It's so simple but so good. Perfectly chewy yet crispy crust, super flavourful (but not salty) sauce, and the most amazing cheese.  I usually don't get such simple pizzas when I go out, but this one is fantastic and I highly highly highly recommend!

I didn't love the salumi di mare - it's a salumi/charcuterie plate but instead of meat it is seafood.  I just found that the textures weren't as satisfying, and the flavours weren't as strong as pork and beef meat platters.  It is definitely interesting, and I think it is one of the most popular things to get at Buca Yorkville, since they are the seafood focused Buca restaurant.",2
783,"I would describe this place as a trendy Italian restaurant. My review will only comment on the pizza as I haven't tried the pastas (it seems like my friends enjoyed them). 
I wasn't too impressed by the pizza, the crust was thin and quite crispy, toppings tasted fresh and good quality but not very generous. It's a good place to go for simple business meetings as the atmosphere is nice and trendy or maybe for a date but if you're looking for a more local small  business type of vibe, I would pass. 
Service was a good and fairly fast. I would mind coming back but not my first choice.",1
676,"I was so looking forward to trying this place out based on all the Yelp reviews and I'm sad to say, my experience here was not a good one.  The cafe is so quaint and located inside a non-descript office building with a cute Koi pond to the side.  

There were 3 people working during a busy-ish lunch time and it took them 15+ min to just take our order.  My daughter's cheese pizza came out first with extra sprinkling of Parmesan cheese which she hates.  It would have been nice to know that even a cheese pizza would come showered in Parmesan.  My husband's lasagna took 30 min to arrive with the same amount of Parmesan on top.  You can see the amount of Parmesan on the photos below.  This was perhaps the best dish of the day still.  The lasagna had a nice meaty sauce and was definitely a pre-made lasagna that was reheated which made us wonder why it would take 30 min to just reheat and serve a premade lasagna.  My fettucine primavera also came doused in too much Parmesan in a tomato sauce that was way too watery and sweet.  Let's just say my pasta was beyond disappointing.  

Based on this experience, I am not sure if I would return here any time soon.",0

To be honest I don't understand why they are awarded with such accolades I stayed in Thailand for a month so I will use that for comparison. 

I find the Khao soi too rich and coconutty. It over takes the subtle nuances of a balanced dish. It just taste like coconut cream soup. I wouldn't make this the quintessential place for Thai food. Support other local businesses.",1

These guys are open and you can order before 4pm unlike some nasty places who don't care about my suffering.

The food is very reasonably priced and pretty good too, a usual is the beef in black bean sauce which is solid and very filling...on the other hand the fried rice dishes are not the greatest and can lack a lot of flavor.

A claustrophobic maze getting in and out of here..  want a coffee/espresso upstairs; FORGET about it; I've been 8 times; only twice was the line under a dozen people, it's good but the line is too long.  Some of the worst cashiers at pizza line; chatting, hugging, orders wrong... I don't think I like this place anymore.",0
2,"Surprisingly good Flautas! They came as 3 rolls made of a crunchy tortilla containing lots of shredded juicy beef (although I thought it tasted more like pork haha). It all sat in a pool of thick savoury sauce that wasn't overly salty. I also tried their White Wine Sangria, $60 for a pitcher was OK for this citrusy drink with a decent amount of alcohol! 

TIP: if you're celebrating a birthday, let the staff know and they'll surprise the bday person with a hat, song & free slice of a DELICIOUS dulce Leche soaked cake !

Otherwise, the indoor seating space is really tight and the service was subpar.",1
1827,"We ordered three items: number 1, 15 and 18. The soy bean milk is so bland, but the other two are pretty good. I like the environment. Serving time is ok. However, no WiFi available. Cash only for 10 dollars or below. Lots of items on the menu.",2
1499,"If you're out late night and want to grab some Asian food, then this restaurant is the perfect spot as it closes at 4am. We came around 9:30pm and the restaurant was pretty packed. You can't expect over the top service compared to other restaurants, but for a typical chinese restaurant standards, this restaurant is on average with it. 

We ordered their bbq pork/roasted pork and the black pepper sauce rice with beef. 
- Bbq Pork/ Roasted Pork: As expected, since it was pretty late at night, the meat wasn't fresh. The roasted pork was cold and the skin wasn't as crunchy vs being fresh. The bbq pork was pretty dry and was not juicy at all.
- Black Pepper Sauce rice with beef: This dish was actually really good which is why the ratings not as low. Since it was cooked fresh, the beef was tender and juicy, and the sauce tasted great. Portion size was pretty decent but for the price you pay, you only really get 3-4 pieces of beef. 

I'll probably skip this place next time if I wanted late night food and try out some other restaurants which were pretty busy as well.",1
227,"I came here for a birthday dinner on Saturday at 8pm. We were a party of 5 and didn't have a reservation so our wait time was around 1hr but only because a reservation was cancelled. If it wasn't, we probably would have waited closer to 2hrs. 
Every time I come to La Carnita, I always get the pollo frito taco but unfortunately they sold out :( I ended up getting the achiote chicken instead and I didn't read the description properly so completely overlooked the jalapeno salsa part. It was so spicy for me, I was tearing up but completely my fault for not reading the menu lol. 
The service was quick, we received our order of Mexican Corn shortly after we placed our order and our tacos came out just before we finished the corn. 

This location is a little cramped for my liking but the food quality is the same with all the other places. I've always enjoyed my dining experience at La Carnita. A reservation is strongly recommended though, otherwise you might have to wait over an hour like I did.",1
556,"Tacos! Love tacos and loved the flavour of the fillings for the tacos here. 

The only thing I wish they did is being able to mix the tacos choices so you could try more of them without going overboard with the meal sizes. Also feel like because of this the prices are a little more than some other taco spots. 

However overall the tacos are great! Had an enjoyable experience. Side note: the churros are massive.",2
105,"I liked it! Came here for dinner with my hubby and we tried sopes for the first time. Sopes is like a taco, but the tortilla is much thicker, I think there's a base of mole sauce spread on it, and there's a lot more meat and veggies piled on. We got 6 different types and I'd say my favourite ones were the chorizo and carnitas (good call by the server who recommended this to us)! Also, it was 3 for $12 so came at a great price. The place is simple yet clean, location is convenient to get to (Bathurst and College, across Sneaky Dees), and the service is knowledgeable and prompt. If I'm in the mood for this type of food, I wouldn't hesitate to come back.",2
1342,"Food 4, 4.5 stars
Not a 5 with the price, average sized portion, about 20 a plate, tad pricey.. place is packed, charge what they want!

ONE STAR for interior; ridiculously loud, annoying.  People hot/sweating, packed everyday, maybe a little AC?
Tight, tight corridors; poor staff, everyone in the way.  Minimal room to maneuver.
Never returning, I'd suggest for those interested; TAKE OUT!",1
1082,"This is go to for us before a game. The food is consistently good. Service is also good with a good offering. Considering the area, it's good value for the money. Atmosphere is quite lively. Pizza is very good ... wood fired. Friendly casual environment. Good place to visit even if you're not attending a game.",1
1140,Great food and service. Highly recommend. If you are coming here we strongly recommend a reservation. It's a small place and very popular.,2
949,"I can't believe there are such high ratings for 7 numbers. I had high expectations for this place before coming due to the reviews. But it was about a 2.5 imho.

Shared the following with hubby...

Arugula salad with red pepper and goat cheese $12
- This was the best dish of the evening (sad isn't it? It was just a salad). I liked it as the goat cheese was part of the dressing. The red pepper was delish but wish the portion was bigger. A tad small for $12

Veal Lasagne - Lasagne with fresh-made pasta sheets, fresh ground veal, mozzarella, and housemade sauce $12.75 (large)
- Our friends ordered a small variation of this and honestly perhaps we should have ordered the small as well. It looked around the same size except it was on a slightly larger plate. There was too much pasta and sauce and too little meat. My friend called her small bowl a snack size pasta. Very saucy. That ""homemade"" sauce seems to make a repeat with a lot of dishes... But it wasn't that impressive. Tasted like something from a can. 

Meatballs - Big meatballs stuffed with mozzarella, smothered in sauce $13
- I didn't like this at all and let my hubby eat most of it. There was only a small pinky tip size mozzarella bit in it. Wasn't even served hot. Way too much sauce. I ended up dipping bread with it.

As for service, the server who served us was very polite but the general manager Tom? (glasses with plaid shirt) was super rude. Three people could not attend last minute and he said something like if I had known, I would have removed this table long ago (they attached another small table to one end). I think he could have handled the situation a lot better. Thanks for denting the mood of a friend's birthday. We noticed Tom kept giving our table dirty looks as well. At least the food came pretty quickly and our server always made sure things were ok. 

Not coming back again. No one was full and we got wings afterwards.",0
250,"Visited Mi Taco Taqueria for a quick snack - guacamole with chips ($4). The nachos did not tasted fresh. I felt like the guacamole and chips ratio is off. It was very disappointing. Perhaps the other items are better. 

Not a big fan. I may be back to give it a second chance to try the tacos.",1
883,"This is one of my favourite places in Toronto for sure. They do such an amazing job with EVERYTHING. Service is always flawless. Atmosphere is classy and cool. 
The menu has so many wonderful things to pick from. Beautiful,well balanced cocktails (they are 17 each mostly, so expensive but so nice). Getting a bunch of items to share is the way to do it. I've been twice now and everything I've ordered has been wonderful! 
Loves of lovely seafood, pasta (the carbonara), the pizza (we had to try truffle one and wow it was wonderful) even dessert is lovely. We had the small doughnuts filled with a Dulce de leche/cream cheese filling. Mmmm soooo good. 

Highly suggest for lunch or dinner.",2
1504,"House of Gourmet is a great spot for late night Chinese food with huge portion at reasonable price! However, don't expect anything extraordinary because you get what you pay for. 

On all of my visits, even ones at 2AM, the place was constantly busy so service always seemed so rushed. The restaurant offers a several options of typical Chinese dishes such as dumplings, fried noodles/rice, soup, etc. My go-to is definitely seafood congee! It is cooked to just the right consistency, not too watery or too thick. Seafood includes shrimp, fish fillet, abalone, scallop, squid and small pieces of ginger that really brings out the flavor! The portion for a small congee is super filling that will likely keep you full until the next meal. I've also tried their noodles soup with BBQ duck & BBQ a few times but it was meh. One time I'd find the broth to be too bland, and other times it was so salty. Other than that, the noodles also comes with generous amount at decent price.

Overall, House of Gourmet is definitely a good choice for late night food, but the quality doesn't really stand out from other restaurants.",1
903,"Bar Buca was on my Bookmark list for brunch for a long time. Their egg skillet pictures impressed me. We didn't come sooner because my husband prefers a simple brunch menu which comes with eggs, bacon, sausage, ham, toast and salad. So, I had waited for a while until today.  

This afternoon I had trouble choosing which restaurant to have brunch at. We decided when it was 2 pm. Luckily, their brunch time is until 4 pm. So, we came to try out their eggs!  

FOOD (3.75/5)

- LA GRANDE COLAZIONE ($16). The dish comes with two hen's eggs, Italian sweet peppers salad (pepronata) and flatbread (tigella) . We saw the picture of the dish with FENNEL SAUSAGES on Yelp. It interested us and we both wanted to try it. However, I couldn't order the same dish as my husband did. I wanted to try something else also. I had a bite though (sigh). The sausage was small. It wasn't enough for two people lol. 

- UOVA CROCCANTI ($14). The dish came with three crispy duck eggs and topped with Buffalo Ricotta (cheese) and Pesto Genovese. The eggs and cheese were very flavourful. If you like cheese, you will love this. I'm not a big fan of buffalo ricotta. I like the taste but the smell was too strong for me. 

DRINK (4/5) 
We had Latte Macchiato ($3.95) and Americano ($2.90). Both were good. We love coffee. 

SERVICE (3/5)
I don't' really want o say that the service is mediocre. There are many reviews say that their services are great. Maybe it wasn't my day. My server was alright. She answered what I asked for but not really what I wanted. It was my first time and I wanted her to explain to us more about the menu and recommend us what the signature dishes are or what the most popular ones. We also don't know Italian! She said something. Short, and that was it! I could catch that those first few items on Salato section were salad and the half on the bottom were egg dishes, I guess. lol, I was disappointed! I was so excited at the beginning becuase I finally had a chance to come to try the brunch menu at Bar Buca. She just turned everything upside down. - -""

OVERALL (3.75/5)
The place was nice. The host was friendly. I love their eggs but I expect a bit more on their egg skillet and their service for the price. Would I come back again? I still want to try other dishes but I am concerned about their service.  We'll see!",1
649,"Buca is straight up wonderful! 

Great food and great service. Make sure you book ahead if you plan to go on weekends! 

Let's get into the review 

Atmosphere 7/10 
For me this aspect I'd give Buca good but not great. As you enter the doors (be weary the area is under construction and can be difficult to find) you walk down a set of stairs to the host counter where you are promptly greeted and take to your table (we arrived early on a Wed evening and were seating without problem). As we settled in, the restaurant was surprisingly loud for having only half the tables full, but as the evening went on It wasn't straining to have conversation among friends. 

Service 8.5/10
Our kind, knowledgable server, Justina, was very helpful throughout the evening. As Buca's menu has many tasty options and each dish has Italian names and it can be a bit tricky to navigate. This was not a problem as Justina was prompt to make some suggestions on top of some ideas our table had in mind for food. Through the duration of the evening she would regularly come to the table with water refill or to just check up and see how we we're doing. A bonus was that she was very well versed with the wine menu and brought 3 sample tastings to the table before we picked the bottle we wanted! 

Food 8/10 

For fine dine Italian Buca does not disappoint. Though we may not have had some of the keynote dishes the menu has to offer we still managed to have a solid taste of what the restaurant is all about. 

1. Nodini (warm bread knots) 8$ (6/10) 
This rating isn't to say these were bad. It's a different take on bread that you'd normally get at most Itn. restos. They were warm, crunchy and the olive oil was good. Nothing too special. 

2. Gnocco Fritto w/ Pancetta 10$ (8.5/10) 
Another bread like app we had with our charcuterie board. These were fantastic! So fantastic we ordered it twice later on in the meal. Served to you on the charcuterie board these large pillow like pastries are fantastic.  Perfectly salted with an intriguing flavour they become quite addicting. 

3. Charcuterie board 21$ (7.5/10) 
For this portion of our apps, Justina was quite helpful in making suggestions as to what cured meats would go well. We had the cured pork salami, spicy pork sausage and cured pork leg. The board comes with a side of preservatives to balance the taste. 

4. Funghi Pizza 32$ (8/10) 
To start for a pizza this is quite pricey but they do not cheap out on the ingredients they use. Topped with seasonal mushroom, marscapone and gorgonzola, this pizza has flavours that linger in your taste buds after each bite. Well worth it to share if you're in a group. 

5. Seafood pasta w/ octopus, mussels 28$ (7.5/10) 
An neat take on a red sauce pasta. Seafood tasted fresh and noddles were perfectly al dente. 

6. Bigoli pasta w/ duck ragu and marscapone 24$ (7/10) 
Presentation of this dish was very pretty, and the flavour wasn't too bold. Overall it was tasty but i'm not sure if i'd have it again when I go back. 

7. Grilled whole sea bass w/ olives & preserved lemon 42$ (6.5/10) 
Fish was fresh tasting but I'm not sure if it's worth the price. Be careful when eating as some bones are still intact. There was some scales on the skin also. 

8. Prosciutto Pizza w/ pesto, asparagus and burrata cheese 30$ (7.5/10)
Same crust as the other pizza and the flavours went well together. The pesto added to the flavour of the cured meat and cheese shavings. 

9.  layered creme wafer w/ strawberry drizzle 10$ (7.5/10) 
This dessert was pretty tasty. Cream layered between 3 wafers sprinkled with icing sugar tasted fresh and simple. A good way to end the night. 

Overall Buca is a typical fine dine Italian with a few neat renditions on several dishes. Their attention to detail and the freshness they incorporate into every dish made this a restaurant I will be eager to visit again.",2
41,"Great tasting, authentic Mexican food! I ordered the 12"" burrito with pork that was tender beyond belief. 
The rice and beans were on point as well! 


The staff were also very friendly and I look forward to supporting this local business again :)",2
824,"This was a very memorable dining experience in Little Italy and was a very good choice.  We made the mistake of coming on a Saturday night without reservations; however, we were able to sit outside.  The poor Canadians!  Most of them couldn't handle the summer heat of dining al fresco on a sweltering day, but this was fine with us.

We were well cared for outside, and the food was terrific.  We got the house red wine which was an affordable and pleasant option.  I got the daivolo pizza and it was cooked to perfection.

These guys really should think about expanding, because they could probably double their business with the number of people they turned away as we dined.  Granted it was a Saturday, but it was obviously a popular option for both locals and tourists like us.",2
1593,"I have never been to a place with king crab tanks all around the entire restaurant!  If you want fresh seafood in front of your eyes, this is the place!  So many options to choose from and between us 6, we chose the crab and lobster and they make it into different entrees.

It was a great experience and we had leftovers as well.
Some of the entrees were a little bland, but everything else definitely had some good flavors, sweet, and fresh!",2
1000,"I went on a Wednesday night around 8pm and was surprised there still many people, however, the wait for a table is not long.  Staff are all very friendly and very informative as I was asking about what wine to drink and etc.  The place is bright and clean but the only thing was I think (at least that's what I believe) there was only one washrooms to share for the entire Eataly.  
Food: the kale salad is a must!  It was so tasty!  The pasta was cooked to my liking (i asked a little cooked over al denta) and pizza was ok.  Overall I would come if there is no long wait.  And I still need to try their desserts!",1
739,"I had this place in my list for a long time and we finally visited during the summer. They have a beautiful patio! We tried Arranchini for appetizers and just loved it... We also have two vegetarian pastas, which were good. the portion sizes were small however the quality of food was rich.",2
463,"Food was great service was slow.

Ordered guacamole n chips freshly made smashed in front of you 

Got a michalada wasn't so bad for Canada 

Ordered chicken torta and it was more of gourmet torta which was really good. Came with sliced chicken breast pieces with there chiptole sauce and ciabatta bread. On the spicy side but was really good 

The place is very nice lots of seating, inside and outside but it was snowing outside so all the tables were taken sat on the bar table. Everyone is friendly and nice just didn't wanna wait 45 mins for a torta and chicken burrito.",2
1908,"We've ordered twice over the past week. It's their Opening Month 10% Discount. This is just a bonus. Ordered three different combinations of Poke. Incredibly fresh and beautifully arranged. Three different rices available, too.",2
1714,"I guess I'm becoming more health-conscious, but after loading up on carbohydrates in the form of noodles, I didn't feel great afterwards. The noodles themselves are a step above your ordinary noodles, I have to admit. They do a good job in the noddles department, but I couldn't shake off the feeling that I ate something that wasn't beneficial for my health or my body. That place was packed on a Friday evening, so I'm guessing it's pretty popular and has a loyal clientele. Despite good service, I probably won't be coming back as my diet and food preferences are slowly shifting toward healthy & nutritious food that good for my body. Everyone has to make their own choice. After all, you are what you eat. Food is medicine if you eat the right food.",1
1257,"We had a quick bite at Banh Mi Boys as it was conveniently located near our hotel.  The menu is a decent size, and you purchase the Banh Mi sandwiches separate from the sides.  The prices are okay for the portion, however it would be nice if the sandwiches came with a little more of the vegetable slaw toppings, as the bun to topping ratio was a little much.  Our sandwiches came out quickly and were warm.  

We tried one each; I went with the Spicy Pork Belly Banh Mi, and my significant other chose the Squid.  My sandwich was really good; the flavors were fresh and delicious.  I went with the medium spicy, which was a spicy sauce.  It was just enough spice for me.  I would have liked to see more of the slaw/toppings on the sandwich.  My significant other's Squid Banh Mi was also very good, and he went with the spicy option of adding jalapenos.  He also wished for a little more of the toppings.   

Banh Mi Boys was good for a quick counter service option to dine in or take out.  My only issue was probably the cleanliness of the place; there was food on the floors and crumbs on the tables, and the garbage was overflowing.  The kitchen looked clean and our food was good, but with the lack of cleanliness in the dining area, it was hard not to feel a little put off.",2
1876,"We came here for Peking Duck around late lunch time and ended up getting dim sum.

Steamed barbecue pork bun: yes! Get this! Flavorful and light. I also enjoyed the pork shrimp and scallop siu mai.

Average items: deep fried mini shrimp ball

Things I didn't care for: deep fried dumpling of Berkshire pork and baby shrimp (tasted like a sesame ball with a filling), baked mini egg tart, steamed soft bun filled with custard, tapioca lychee and mango in chilled sweet soup

DO NOT GET: steamed short spare rib in garlic and toasted garlic. This dish was horrendous! It was slimy!

We weren't too impressed so we left to have another meal around the corner.",0
1324,"So many different ramen options to choose from. I chose the spicy white sesame shio ramen and it is unlike any bowl of ramen I have had from any ramen restaurant. It was the perfect amount of spice and didn't taste too salty for me. Our water glasses usually got refilled before it got to the halfway point and we never had to go thirsty waiting for water. 

The Yelp waitlist time estimate is not really accurate and our table for 2 was ready about 6 or 7 places on the waitlist (about 30 min) early. Thankfully the place takes down your name and phone number and will text you a few minutes before your table is ready.",2
657,"I came on a Monday around 5pm with two other people. We ordered 3 dishes (ravioli, lobster pasta and shrimp with veggies) and spent over 100$. Here is a short pros and cons list: 

Pros: 
- The food is good 
- The chef gave us some bread with butter, vinegar and olive oil on the side. He also gave us some baked zucchini as an appetizer. 
- He seems knowledgeable about Italian cuisine. He said that he cooked in Italy for 7 years. 
- a lot of street parking nearby

Cons: 
- The restaurant smells like cat. The odour was very strong. 
- The bathroom is in the basement with a very very low ceiling. It reminded me of the bathrooms one would expect to see at a campsite, so it's very usable, but lots of bugs. 
- The decor is very outdated. 
- Too expensive. The ravioli dish was composed of 4 big ravioli. The lobster pasta was also a fair portion. The shrimp with veggies was my main issue. It cost over 25$ if I recall correctly. It was 3 shrimp with a handful or two of steamed veggies. For the price we paid, we expected more. After we finished our meal, we were still not fully satisfied. We ended up going somewhere else and eating more. 

In my opinion, the cons greatly outweigh the pros. There are many other cleaner Italian restaurants that serve much more equally delicious food for the same price.",0
1506,"Spontaneous craving for Chinese food but wanting to give other restaurants a chance in Chinatown led me to House of Gourmet. 

Portions are on the smaller side and they were decent enough to satisfy cravings. Wasn't much of a wow factor in my opinion. Ordered Yeung Chow fried rice, sweet and sour pork, beef soya sauce noodles, turnip cakes and snow peas for a group of 4. Topped it off with a iced lemon tea each.",1
1500,"I came to House of Gourmet looking for a quick lunch break from work. 

It's been quite a while since I had some noodles in soup so I decided upon going to a place I've known since childhood. Upon entering, I was seated immediately and I ordered a bowl of Beef Brisket Rice Noodle Soup. 

The broth was exactly how I remembered from my youth. Layers of flavour, while still retaining its heat. The rice noodles were cooked to a decent al dente, however the beef brisket was a bit disappointing. It was not tender and took quite a while for me to chew. I did wish they cooked down the brisket a lot more as any good beef noodle soup does require soft and tender beef brisket. 

The service is what you would expect at any quick service Chinese restaurant. You go there, order quickly, eat and get out. 

It's a great place for a quick bite from their wide extensive menu, especially if you're looking for a homestyle meal after the bar/club. This place has lot a bit of its mystique from its hey day but it is still one of Chinatown's prime spots for Cantonese food.",1
1793,Cockroaches running around.  This place is very dirty and the food isn't nice.  I would not recommend unless you are asking for a stomach ache.,0
528,"I ordered a taco from here, the Monterrey Steak. So tiny, it fits in the palm of your hand. Taste was ok but I don't think it is worth $6-7.",0
1814,"Since living in LA and having a chance to go to Din Tai Fung whenever I wanted, it makes it really hard to think anywhere else could be better. This place was authentic and tastes like bistro dim sum. We got the soup dumplings, shrimp steamed dumplings, and scallion beef rolls.",1
1211,"Came here on a Monday at lunch and it was really busy. I love the cool, hipster vibe of this place, it feels very casual, has really cool decor, theres a bar and overall it just feels comfortable.
We ordered the Papaya Salad which I really liked. The papaya is soaked in tamarind sauce giving it a sweet & sour taste, it came with flavourful shrimp chips, crispy pork grinds, some noodles and cabbage. Everything eaten together tastes so good! Definitely recommend!
I had the Masaman Beef Curry, at first the bowl looks kind of small but its actually very filling. They give you a lot of beef (perfect for meat lovers) and its very tender. The curry tastes like regular curry but with a hint of sweet&sour tamarind which I really liked.
My friend had the Khao Soi and to me it was just ok, it tastes like a regular coconut curry. Reminds me of a Malaysian Laksa.",2
1785,"TL;DR Delicious Chinese food but not exactly authentic Sichuan. 

We ordered takeout on a Saturday night - green beans with pork, gong bao chicken, and mapo tofu. 

The green beans with pork was a standout, the beans tasted fresh while nicely fried at the same time, the dish could have used slightly larger pork crumbs though. 

The gongbao chicken was definitely not authentic - it was a bit saucy compared to the normal version and the chicken pieces were larger than normal. It was not spicy at all and maybe a bit sweet. It was still tasty. 

The mapo tofu was also a standout - a bit spicy and very flavourful.
 The portions were large and generous. We can't comment on cleanliness or service since we ordered delivery via DoorDash. 

One star off since neither of us felt like it was authentic Sichuan cuisine - too much cornstarch and a tad too sweet. It was tasty nonetheless. Side note, we both had poor stomaches a few hours after dinner. Can't tell if it was from the meal, just figured we'd add in case.",1
1348,"Spice levels were a bit all over the place. The curry was spicier than the pad thai and chicken kua gling, even though we ordered it with less spice than the others. 

The Thai iced tea was pretty good. Started out a bit syrupy but was perfect once the ice started melting.",1
181,"Ordered beef burrito and pork pupusas through ubereats.
Started with the burrito which was bland and barely any beef/protein. I couldn't even finish the burrito because it was so bad and I decided to try the pupusas.
It was hard by the time I got to it. Think twice before ordering...",0
1209,"THIS PLACE WAS SOOOOO GOOD! I was in Toronto for a women's conference and my friend and I decided to check this place out for dinner. We were promptly seated and given menus. She's a vegetarian and they had really nice options to choose from. I went with the pad Thai. We got our food and holy portions! I ate mine for dinner, a later meal before bed, then STILL had some left for the next day. My friend got the soup and also got 2 meals out of it. Service was great, location was great and priced very reasonable for downtown Toronto!",2
1494,"Review is for take out. Normally when I order crispy chow mein, other restaurants will separate the sauce and the noodles. Not here, by the time I got home the noodles were all soggy  

The shrimp spring roll was such a disappointment with barely any shrimp, only one bite actually had shrimp in there. 

I ordered via Ritual so I thought the pick up would be simple. There is absolutely no physical distancing at all, the entrance was tight, people were crammed and confused, overall it was chaotic. Improvement needed.",0
683,"This is one of my favourite newly found gems for great pasta! All the staff are extremely friendly and greet you right as you walk in. What's great about it is that you can't eat for here and pack it to go! Another great thing about Baretto Caffe is that you're able to pick what kind of pasta you'd like to eat (rotini, fettuccini, penne, etc.). I've had their rosé rotini pasta and it's to die for. It tastes very authentic to their culture and its great for its price. I'd like to say that their food was the star of the show, however their service and friendliness of all the staff really made it one of the most enjoyable and pleasant dining experiences I've had, if not the best! I would go here again :)

57,"I took the advice of one of the reviewers on Yelp & I got the hybrid burrito.  Boy was I disappointed.  I thought the flavours were sooo bland & the burrito itself was rice heavy & lacked sufficient amount of meat. Seriously I didn't even want to finish it.

Also it seemed like (from the pics on here) that this was a take out place, but it's not.  It's all table service.  

I just think this restaurant did not hold a candle to restaurants in the same price range.  In other words, it was ridiculously over-priced for what you get.  The burrito alone was around $15.",0

1157,"What's for lunch? I didn't feel like having what was prepared at work so I went for a walk, hoping to be inspired. My wandering took me through nearby Yorkville, where there are many restaurants. Surely, I can find something there.

I came across Dimmi Bar & Trattoria and it looked interesting, with a patio in a pedestrian walkway. There were a few tables available so why not? I like Italian food.

I was greeted and seated quickly and I ordered Spaghetti with Meatballs. Simple. It arrived fairly quickly and tasted pretty good, especially with freshly grated cheese on it. The meatballs were a bit on the smaller side but they tasted good. The pasta was cooked properly and the sauce was also very good. This was a good meal!

Unfortunately, I won't be working in this area much longer but I'll try to drop in again for a meal before I leave. It was good.",2
438,"Absolutely love this place!

Me and my husband have been coming here for years.  The staff is friendly and attentive and the food is delicious.

The prices may shock you at first but all the produce and meat is well sourced and the portions are quite large so you really get what you pay for.  We always make sure to try at least one new thing off the menu whenever we go and are never disappointed.

The food is always fresh and bright and completely satisfying and the close, intimate setting always reminds us of my husband's mother's kitchen. 

A great hidden gem and a must try in the city.  It's definitely worth a walk along Queen street.",2
748,I came here and had a short male server with a buzz cut and glasses that was very rude.,0

The only thing is that my food was supposed to go in the oven, so my husband dish came first. He finished his meal and then I finally got mine. We complained nicely to the server, but I don't think it made difference. 
I also had a frozen Margherita (which I liked very much) But overall, it's a nice place.",1
998,"This review is for La Focaccia in Eataly. The technique they use to bake their pizza is absolutely divine. The crust is crunchy yet each bite into the pizza is so soft. 

I tried 4 different slices of pizza here and they were all equally amazing so don't even bother following my pizza order and just order what sounds good to you because I promise it'll blow you away.

The pizzas are made fresh and turnover is high (given the long line so the demand is high!). You can see the chefs making the pizza while you wait in line too! 

I'm already thinking about my next visit here and you bet I'll be ordering another slice (or 3) before I head home :)

P.S. You can ask them to reheat your pozza if you're eating it immediately",2
1057,"Going to start off this review by saying the food was great. Our table ordered the Caesar salad, gnocchi ragu, lobster pasta, and tagliolini con funghi. Wonderful food. 

Why the 3 stars? Boy, did we have the most annoyingly cocky/rude/ignorant waiter?! This customer service experience was so frustrating that it warranted a Yelp review. 
Upon entering the restaurant, everyone from the host to the bartenders had been amazing. We came on a busy night and we had no reservations, and the host had us seated at the bar while he scrambled to get us a table for 6. The bartender was great company, and we enjoyed our cocktails while waiting for a table. 
Of course once we were seated, we got stuck with this sarcastic douche bag of an employee... suddenly regretted choosing this restaurant just because of this dude. He made a lot of rude comments, maybe he thought he was funny? Somehow the conversation with him had eventually evolved into him reminiscing about getting 'so f**ked up one time' while our family was trying to enjoy our dinner. That was just the icing on the cake. 

The food did actually take a bit long to come out. We had waited a good half hour after ordering. 

If you can tolerate the company of some really rude and (not funny) sarcastic waiters, then I do recommend trying the food here. Otherwise, there are better places to spend $30-50 per person on dinner that will guarantee better service. Hopefully if you do go, you get a better server.",1
1287,"AMAZING. We really enjoy Mediterranean cuisine but it's always been pretty traditional fare. Byblos does it different.  You may have tried dishes that were similar to it in the past, but I guarantee they will surprise and delight your taste buds.

First off, cocktails are a must.  I ordered the ""Sultan's Privilege"".  The bartender is very talented...highly recommend one of their signature cocktails.

We ordered the roasted red beets (think bread with yogurt dip),l and Turkish mantis dumplings.  Both we delicious and completely not what we expected.

Next we ordered the grilled whole branzino with the sweet jewelled rice, and roasted Brussels sprouts (sides are ordered a la carte). The fish was perfectly cooked...juicy and flighty flaky white fish, with beautiful parsley rub and crunchy skin, Brussels sprouts were very tasty, and the rice was a delightful balance of sweet and savoury.

Finally for dessert we ordered the orange blossom mousse and the pizzelle. Both were a perfect way to finish off our meal.",2
894,"I really wanted to like this place. The staff were friendly, and the food LOOKED good.

Alas - not to be.

We came here because my friend was craving their crespelle (olive oil fried pancakes). That was ok - it was a bit greasier than we thought it would be (and I say this as someone who loves olive oil cake) and was lacking in taste. The bombolone sandwich was delicious - the pun was the perfect texture complement to the sausage. And the tiramisu was also super disappointing - it was their ""take"" but was definitely not an improvement.

Damn.

I'd say this is more of a 3.5/5.",1
814,"This place is pretty much the definition of a hole in the wall (which full disclosure is in my opinion the best type of restaurant). It's dark and tiny and has very intimate and authentic vibe. 

We started with the meatballs appetizer and those things were melt in your mouth amazing. The marinara was so rich and flavourful we were ecstatic when the server dropped off some bread so we could soak up every last bit of it. 

We opted to share a couple things since neither of us had been there before:

The Bolognese Rigatoni and the Diavolo Pizza. Both were great but the real standout was the Rigatoni. We both heavily favoured it. The sauce was rich and hearty the pasta perfectly al dente, there was absolutely nothing lacking in this dish. 

The only down downside to our experience here was we did have to wait with dirty dishes on our table (which is my biggest restaurant pet peeve) for about 15 minutes after we had finished eating to get our bill. Normally this would really bother me but the friendliness of the staff and the quality of the food really made this place enjoyable.

We look forward to coming back.",2
1756,"Dim sum wasn't bad. I actually preferred this over the downtown China Town dim sum, but markham was better. But if don't feel like a drive thru traffic, not a bad second choice.

Ignore the decor or I think if they rearranged some stuff it would look good. 

Service was attentive but only one server who did everything so be patient. Other reviewers did mention they were out of certain items...which if they were, they should inform us and not have it on the board.

Will go back...",1
341,"Good tacos but Seven Lives is still King. Expensive tho, about $70 with 2 drinks and tax and tip. Not sure id be hurrying to go back. 

I'd check out Good Hombres, Gus Taqueria, and Seven Lives first.",1
1760,"You can truly taste the difference in quality of dim sof Dynasty compare to other dim sum places downtown Toronto.  The dishes are flavourful and fresh.  I highly recommend calling in to reserve a table, otherwise expect to wait 20-30 mins for one.  The only downside is that customer service isnt so great.  Once you place your order, your food will come when dishes are ready.  The waiters will not come check up on you. Ive noticed this when it is a full house of customers.",2
266,"We went on a Friday night and the wait was 40 minutes, so we decided to explore the area near us until we received a text that our table was ready. They led us to our table only to find that people were still sitting there. It took them 15 minutes to figure out another table for us. When we finally sat down, we were given menus and the food here is not cheap at all. We decided to get some chips and salsa to share with 2 tacos each. The salsa came in a tiny container that was barely enough for one person. We waited another 45 minutes for the tacos for them to be cold.",1
967,"Unbelievably fresh, made in front of your eyes pasta ! Service was exceptional ! Although they said restaurant closes at 2 pm - they never stopped serving everyone that stood in line. Favourite was the stuffed ravioli !",2
244,"Very cozy little place. I was passing by and noticed it and couldn't help buy try what they had to offer.
I ordered Baha tacos and churro. 
Very tasty tacos! A bit pricy I would say 5 bucks for one. But I really enjoyed it and would have it again.
Churro was ok, a bit too crispy for my taste and I wouldn't order it again.  
Overall I was pleased with my food!",2
1156,"Short and Sweet: 
The food was delicious, but the service was lacking. 

Long Story... Long: 
My friend and I both got the grilled calamari. It was delicious and well made. The calamari was a generous portion that fit the price.

The service, however, ruined my visit a bit. We had multiple different waiters, which was confusing. The one towards the end, who had given us our bill was kind and attentive, but the others were rushed, asked the same questions/clarifications multiple times, and generally felt uncomfortable.

I had asked for a balsamic reduction sauce for my order, if possible. I was told that it was, and the waiter came back with what looked like olive oil and balsamic vinegar together in a small container, which can actually be found on our table. I thought, ""this is not what I meant, but no problem."" I got charged 3 extra dollars for this, which I was both unaware of and unhappy about. Apparently they had added truffle oil, which in my experience is distinct and I can normally tell, but I could not in this instance. This is also where the added price came from.

I would have preferred being warned that there would be an extra charge and that they couldn't do the balsamic reduction sauce in the first place.

Otherwise, I did really like the dish, but the overall experience makes me want to pick another restaurant in the Yorkville area.",1
863,"I'm really not trying to be passive aggressive but honestly, this is my interpretation of this restaurant and the patrons who have rated it so highly.  I feel it received the acclamation it has (voted one of most romantic restaurants in the city and all the 5 star ratings) because (a)  it's in Yorkville and (b) guests MAY mostly include those that don't dine out in the city as often.  The ones that usually do on special occasions

Look, this city has an abundance of fantastic restaurants led by a generation of daring, creative and exciting chefs.  So when I come to Blu, that is a self proclaimed ""fine dining"" restaurant, I'm expecting everything to be elevated.  Not everyone can be Alo, I get it, but it's the expectation that's set which I'm comparing the experience to.  

For starters we got carpaccio, tuna tartar and the octopus. The carpaccio was your typical combination of flavors that I can recite in my sleep (meet, Capers, some creamy sauce, truffle oil ,arugula for garnish.  Maybe not exactly but you know what I mean).  The tartar was tasty from what I recall but the ""octopus"" omg.  First off they seemed to be 2 squid tentacles, very small and burnt.  On one side is a pineapple chutney of sorts and on the other side is an eggplant purée.  It's octopus! Can't really mess that up and don't ever pair is with anything so overpowering. The eggplant ok fine maybe but the Indian flavors did not complement the fish at all.  

On to main course.  My wife had the wild boar ragu.  First couple of bites and you're thinking wow this is delicious but I could see where my wife was coming from when she said the sweetness in that dish is just too much.  You almost get sick of it near the end.  But she ate most of it and whatever it was fine.  I had the seafood pasta.  It was good.  Fresh seafood, pasta and light olive oil sauce.  Nothing extra just what you'd expect I guess.  

The ambiance is great and we loved the service.  They have a nice drink menu and prices were what you'd expect for Yorkville.  

Overall is was a great night and my wife and I didn't leave the restaurant angry.  We enjoyed the food but again it's setting the expectation.  Everything we ate tasted like how they should and we've had those same flavors many times before.  but we were expecting more imagination with flavors and presentation.  Unfortunately Blu didn't deliver",1
583,"II really, really wanted to just love this place and sorry about the loooong review (i am normally not one to have such an extended view) BUT I made two mistakes today:

1) Cancelling my reservation at Playa Cabana ( the last 5:00 pm spot) to go to this restaurant (SMH)
2) The place is supposed to open at 5,like a dumbass I actually waited until 5:20 when they finally decided they felt like opening.

That kind of slackness will get your business shut down in Toronto, with sooooooooooo many good places to go and eat all within blocks who the hell is really gonna stick around and wait for places to open past the time they should be??? ....ohhhhhhhhh the regret folks.   

When I walked in ,there were only two other people seated ( who also decided to sit outside and wait saw them earlier)..hmm wonder if they too had regret, but anyways onto the experience. Walked in and there was a bartender and 1 person sitting at the bar. So we seat ourselves at the front of the restaurant and it literally took the guy behind the bar 10 min. to finally put down some menus, he goes back to the bar chitty chatty with the guy sitting at the bar another 10 min goes by he  comes back to take the order. We order drinks and food (Sabinita-- layers of refried black beans, cheese, sour cream & guacamole, Poblanito -soft tortilla; mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds) and two Pescado- mole poblano sauce w/shredded chicken breast; garnished w/sesame seeds). 

Slowly two of the wait staff make their way in and the guy behind the bar says something in spanish possibly about being late who knows seems to be the trend here, and then another table of patrons come in and than another the wait staff all of two seem confused and dazed. The Sabinita comes to to the table and I ask the waiter if our drinks are coming he says he doesn't know, 5 min later the rest of the order comes out I ask again about the drinks another guy comes over with a menu I said no I ordered them when I first sat down? Repeated the order ( like really the bartender couldn't remember to send out the friggin drinks when at the time there was a total of 4ppl in the place (I could just imagine if there were more than 12 ppl in this place it would be like chaos to remember OMG all these drinks OMG ....seriously its like amateure night in here).

 He comes back minutes later with the drinks, in all fairness not his fault he didn't take the order initially nor was he the  DUH guy that said didn't know when the drinks were coming, and that is the last time we saw anyone come over,no one came by to check on the table to see if everything was good ( which it was NOT) and the place was not busy 4 tables occupied does not constitute as busy.   

 The Poblanito was just ok , the fish tacos were downright dreadful they were breaded in some sort of cornmeal which  was not an issue but the fish they used had a gelatinous texture and honestly there wasn't a dash of seasoning in the coating or the fish itself  not even the toppings were seasoned. IT WAS BLAND  i could barely get through it so so i doused it with hot sauce and still it stank (tastewise) so I only ate the one left the other one on the plate and covered it with my napkin (RIP).

 So now all I have left is half a beer which i'm chugging so I can get the hell outta there!! I indicate to the waiter that we're ready to leave and the bill arrives and he asked how was it ?  I was blunt, honest said it was terrible he was concerned surprised and wanted specifics, so I went off about the fish he said he would go and let the the guy in the back know ,  I said really you don't have to but off he went came back apologised. I said I guess that is just how its done here the only redeeming thing about this whole meal was the Sabinita & the beer.

 Sad to say but  I'm not one to give 2nd chances when it comes to food & service like I said this city is a ""Food Mecca"" too many other places to go and try, so bottom line I would never venture back to this place, I would rather take my $$ and go around the corner to Barrio Coreano or Tacos El Asador where the service and food at least in my experiences have been consistently great .",0
1181,"4 stars overall. It was a good dining experience though not sure if I'll be back.

5 stars for the La Giulietta pizza, tiramisu and soft serve. All of them tasted amazing. Also, kudos to the great service and decor.

4 stars for the octopus. It was well cooked and really tasty, though not the best I've had.

3.5 stars for the cioppino since there wasn't enough seafood. 3 stars for the pappardelle rage since it wasn't as tasty as it could have been.",2
323,"I really had high hopes after Reading the other reviews on yelp. Perhaps my review is a little muddied from the fact that I just returned from Mexico City. Nonetheless I found the food to be tasteful, but I'm afraid most of the food we ordered-  the ceviche and the soup was pre- frozen and de thawed to serve. 

Granted we did come in on Monday evening and it was quite dead so I don't think they had a full kitchen working that night. I think I might return one more time on the weekend or a Friday night to see if the service and the food is anymore fresh.",1
1625,"I was craving soup dumplings and this restaurant has such good reviews that I just had to come here. It's a tiny restaurant down some steps, so it might be hard at first to find if you don't know what you're looking for exactly. There isn't a ton of seats, so if it's busy, you might need to wait for a table.

The restaurant itself could use a huge facelift. The washrooms were dirty and very small. The whole place just feels outdated - minus the tables and chairs. I came on a busy Saturday night but was seated fairly quickly. They cleaned my table before I was seated but the dish cloth they used to wipe the table was definitely used.. my table just smelled like a used dish cloth, sadly.
There were also a TON of mosquitos. We were seated right in front the of door, so perhaps this could be why.. but the most odd thing is that they would just drop onto our table and food, and almost die or stop moving instantly. Not sure what was going on.. but it ruined my appetite. 

ONTO THE FOOD: the most important reason why I'm reviewing! We ordered the Juicy Pork Dumplings (soup dumplings), fried shrimp & pork dumplings, & chive pancakes. The soup dumplings were just okay. The filling wasn't as flavourful as other ones that I've tried from other places. It was missing something but I can't figure out what it is. The pancakes were really good, and I wish I ate more but they were dripping I grease, so I couldn't eat more than 2. I didn't have any of the fried dumplings but my boyfriend said they were very greasy as well. We actually had to go get a drink from a bar close by just to get rid of the greasy feel in our mouths.

I honestly wouldn't come back here myself. A lot of other people gave this place high reviews so I'm not sure if I just had a bad experience or not. But the greasy food and mosquitos flying around or dropped dead in front of us wasn't acceptable.",0
56,"This is probably the most legit Mexican restaurant in all of Toronto. Arguably the best burritos. Outstanding chicken mole. Great pozzole. Nice, kind hosts. Often, you will be served by the owners. 

Yeah, I go there a lot...",2
1818,"Not bad but quality control should be supervised.

We order probably once a month and food quality is a hit or miss.

Like today, broccoli was old. 

Some time the beef noodles, the beef is tough.",1
207,"To be completely honest. I was expecting more.
I came in during my lunch while practically salivating on hearing the reviews. I ordered the 3 TACOS: FISH, BARBACOA? AND CARNITAS. fish taco was so bland and had no taste. The beef was pretty good. CARNITAS was decent. Service left more to be desired as the gentleman never asked if I wanted anything else but just requested I pay. Felt rushed.!",0
286,"Located just across the street from the Broadview TTC station the place is hard to miss. A no frill joint with simple Mexican decor. Based on the reviews ordered the 3 for10$ tacos : Asada, steak and chorizo... I had a lot of hope , but crash landed my expectations with dry and not so fresh tacos. Honestly not at all up to the mark. Wife ordered a tostada with tinga de pollo ( chicken) and was equally disappointed with the serving size and taste. We definitely need to go back to Seven Lives to reset our experience.",0
733,"I was here over the weekend for a romantic dinner. The staff are lovely and the service was great. Amazing dishes, I highly recommend building your own charcuterie board. It's intimate and candlelit. When I made my reservation, they were very accommodating and replied quickly with answers to my questions.",2
1099,"Recommended:
Veal marsala with penne

Ok:
Shrimp and scallops in wine sauce

Meh:
Roasted bell peppers. They're ok, but the quantity makes no sense unless you have a group to share with.

This type of food is really not my thing. A bit too straight forward and bland.

The food is simple Italian, but not special. The veal was well seasoned but a bit chewy. Still it was better than the shrimp and scallops dish, which contained small scallops and shrimp which seemed overcooked or reheated.

Olive oil and vinegar bottles are covered with corks which are very greasy. I have no idea how these could possibly be clean. Your fingers get dirty at minimum.

For the price, I expect higher quality or at least more interesting food.

Service was a bit absent at times, but passable overall. They only have one credit card machine, which created a bottleneck of a few minutes. It didn't matter this night, but if you have a time constraint, it is not a fast meal. The waiter explained and apologized, at least.",0
275,"There's lots of mixed reviews for this restaurant. Glowing reviews versus one that speak of terrible service. My review errs on the side of the not so good. I'd say 2.5 stars for me.

Are all Mexican restaurants so dim? It seems that the ones I've been to are always so dark and hard to see. In terms of price it's on the pricey side. My friend took me to a food truck in LA and it was either $1 or $1.50 per taco. I suppose you're paying for the atmosphere and sit down service but ~$6/taco is quite the surcharge. I'll give them that the carne asada taco was tasty but in my opinion that still doesn't justify paying so much per taco. They're small so it's not like you're going to have just 1.

I saw horchata on the menu and decided to try it here. It was very watered down. I didn't taste any cinnamon at all either. definitely not worth $4. 

The server told us that they want to be the best fried chicken place in Toronto. I'd say that they have quite a ways to go until they can claim that title. Perhaps it was just the pieces I got but the skin was soft and not crispy. It was also kinda bland without slathering it in sauce. Turns out the dip that we had with the chips was a better accompaniment for the fried chicken instead of the sauce it came with. Go figure. 

That's a lot of negatives that I've listed. The positives are that our server was great and available when we needed her, the atmosphere was good, we were comfortable and didn't feel rushed to finish our meal. Although, paying for our bill took some time. Maybe the person taking payment didn't realize we were ready to pay because our server came back around after about 15 min of us waiting to speed up the process. 

I'd spent almost $30 and left unsatisfied with value for money and felt like I hardly had anything to eat.",1
