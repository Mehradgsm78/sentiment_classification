sentiment_classification
==============================

The objective of this project is to build a sentiment classifier to classify restaurant reviews.

I will be using the file reviews_res.csv that contains close to 2000 reviews. Values in reviews.csv are tab separated instead
of comma. 

Task
The main task is to do sentiment analysis of the reviews. I will do this by training and testing a BoW text classifier on the review
texts using RatingValue as labels. The ratings are binned into negative (ratings 1 & 2 ), neutral (rating 3 ) and positive
(ratings 4 & 5 ) sentiment. The binned ratings are coded with negative as 0 , neutral as 1 and positive as 2 . This new
column is called Sentiment.

However, the ratings are very unbalanced, there are many more positive ( 2 ) ratings than negative ( 0 ) ratings. By dropping
the positive ratings we can balance the data so that we have approximately equal numbers of negative, neutral and positive
ratings.

Once this is done, the data is split into training and validation sets and saved as train.csv and valid.csv (saved in data/interim folder). The
validation data should be used for model selection and evaluation.
